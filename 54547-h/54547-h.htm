<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c1"><br />1. SPACE SHIP <i>ORION</i></h2>
<p>The orphanage dormitory was locked in the stillness
of slumber. Light from the full moon filtered
through the large window which ran the entire
length of the boys sleeping quarters.</p>
<p>Twenty cots filled the dormitory, and all but one
held its sleeper. Dark-haired Garry Coleman was
standing beside his cot, quietly dressing. Every now
and then he would cast an anxious glance toward
the darkened door at the end of the dormitory.
Above all, he must not disturb the charge-of-quarters,
or all would be lost.</p>
<p>As he sat on the edge of the cot to put on his
shoes, Garry heard a squeak from one of the cots.
He stiffened, his heart thumping fearfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Then Garry breathed easily. He saw that it was
only Patch, who occupied the bunk next to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Garry, where are you going?&rdquo; Patch asked
interestedly.</p>
<p>Patch was short and towheaded. He was Garry&rsquo;s
best friend, and so Garry did not mind telling him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the spaceport and watch the <i>Orion</i>
blast off for the Von Braun Space Station. Want to
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take the same chance that I do,&rdquo;
Garry reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay by me.&rdquo; Patch grinned. &ldquo;If we do
get caught, we&rsquo;ll just be restricted to the grounds
for two weeks. That won&rsquo;t keep us out of the
science lab where we spend a lot of time anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a warm April night. The sky was thick
with stars as bright as diamond dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything to be out there in the deeps
among the planets,&rdquo; Garry said, as they hurried
across the newly sprouting lawn of the orphanage
a few minutes later. &ldquo;The life of a spaceman must
be the most exciting thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Patch agreed. &ldquo;But I guess we&rsquo;ll never
make it, Garry, at least not for many years. And
they say you sure have to know science and navigation.
That takes a lot of study.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care what it takes,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
be willing to study for as long as it would take, because
the reward would be worth the effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their rapid steps took them onto one of the
main streets of the city where moving sidewalks,
called &ldquo;Ped-A-Rides,&rdquo; were operating. The sidewalk
was a continuous belt, about six feet wide, and
there were benches located at intervals upon it
where the pedestrians could sit. A railing was on
both sides of the Ped-A-Ride, but at intervals of
about half a block there were gates where pedestrians
could enter.</p>
<p>Patch and Garry went to the nearest gate, and
Garry pulled the lever which slowed the sidewalk
down so that they could board it. When Garry had
deposited their fare in the meter, a bar slid away so
that they could enter. It was about 2230 o&rsquo;clock, an
hour and a half before midnight, and not many
people were on the Ped-A-Ride.</p>
<p>The boys took seats, and the sidewalk carried
them along into the night.</p>
<p>As the Ped-A-Ride topped the crest of a hill,
Garry pointed into the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is, Patch&mdash;the <i>Orion</i>, smoking and
straining like a race horse, just as if she can&rsquo;t wait
to get going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sure is a beauty,&rdquo; Patch agreed. &ldquo;The earth-bound
ships are a whole lot trimmer and better
looking than the ships that never touch down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;The earth-bound ships have to be streamlined
so that they can slide smoothly through the earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere,&rdquo; Garry said, &ldquo;but the ships that remain
in space look like a bunch of globes and girders,
because they never meet the friction of any planet&rsquo;s
atmosphere and they don&rsquo;t need the sturdiness and
rocket power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch laughed. &ldquo;You sound like one of our
schoolbooks, Garry,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>As the Ped-A-Ride neared the spaceport, the
brilliant lights of the busy area merged into a hazy
glare that brightened the night until it was almost
as light as day. The slim prow of the <i>Orion</i> reached
higher into the sky than any other object on the
vast field, even loftier than the giant control tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say the <i>Orion</i> is more space scarred than
any other ship in the Space Service,&rdquo; Garry remarked.
&ldquo;Meteor dust has grooved her sides so
much that they look like the scratches on a rifle
bullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew she was one of the oldest crafts in the
Service,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s carried many a
person to the Von Braun Station on their way to
Luna and the other planets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The Ped-A-Ride had nearly reached the gate of
the spaceport when Garry said to his friend,
&ldquo;Patch, we&rsquo;d better move down among those people
ahead of us. It looks like they&rsquo;re going to get
off at the port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one of the port police spots us, he might get
suspicious seeing a couple of kids alone at this time
of night. If we mingle with the crowd, the police
may think we are with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got up and began walking forward along
the moving platform. Then they took seats behind
a man who wore the uniform of the Space Service.
He had several bags, and it seemed likely that he
was going to board the <i>Orion</i>.</p>
<p>As the Ped-A-Ride neared the port gate, Garry
closely studied the stalwart young man seated before
them. Garry wondered at the many experiences
that must have been encountered by this
spaceman during his career.</p>
<p>Garry leaned over and touched the spaceman on
the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you boarding the
<i>Orion</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry saw a pleasant but deeply lined face
turned upward toward his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the astronaut replied, then asked, &ldquo;Are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, no, Sir,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;We&mdash;my friend and
I&mdash;we just want to see her blast off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The spaceman smiled. &ldquo;Guess you are pretty interested
in space to be coming all the way to the
port just to see an old crate like the <i>Orion</i> blast off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are, Sir,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very interested
in it. I hope to be a spaceman someday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will be, too,&rdquo; the man said confidently.
&ldquo;I can see the enthusiasm in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Garry returned. &ldquo;Have you made
many trips spaceward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dozen or so,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The number is
not important, though, you must understand. Usually,
one voyage can last quite a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spaceman extended a big, sunburned hand
to Garry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m First Space Officer Mulroy. What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, Sir. Garry Coleman. My friend here is
Patrick Foster, but he&rsquo;s called Patch for short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Ped-A-Ride neared the gate of the spaceport,
Garry had an idea by which he and Patch
might get inside without being questioned by the
port police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mulroy,&rdquo; Garry said, &ldquo;I notice that you
have some baggage. I wonder if Patch and I could
help you carry it&mdash;maybe aboard the <i>Orion</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer smiled. &ldquo;You want to see what she
looks like, eh? Okay, it&rsquo;s a deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sir,&rdquo; Garry said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Presently Officer Mulroy stood up. &ldquo;Here we are,
fellows,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get our things together
quickly. I can&rsquo;t afford to miss my blast-off on the
<i>Orion</i>. I have a sailing date for Mars in a few weeks,
and the stars wait for no man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c2"><br />2. BLAST-OFF</h2>
<p>Once inside the gate, Mr. Mulroy spoke to a uniformed
officer, who saluted. The officer turned a
tiny dial on a lapel button he wore and spoke into
it. Garry knew this to be a subminiature radio
transmitter which was in wide use.</p>
<p>Presently, a square little &ldquo;T-Car,&rdquo; or tote car,
drove up. It was painted green and white, streamlined,
and had seats inside. It had a convertible
top which was opened now because of the pleasant
weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The baggageman put the spaceman&rsquo;s things in
the compartment, then invited his passengers to
enter at the door he held open. Garry and Patch
felt very important as Officer Mulroy motioned
them in ahead of himself. They felt even more important
as they sank down into the soft seats and
were joined a moment later by this high-ranking
officer of the Space Service.</p>
<p>The swift little car whisked them off to the Operations
Building, to which Officer Mulroy had to
report before his flight.</p>
<p>When the baggage had been unloaded outside
and the T-Car had moved off, the spaceman said to
the boys, &ldquo;Wait out here, until I sign up and get my
instructions. Then we&rsquo;ll carry my things aboard the
<i>Orion</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they waited, they turned their attention
to the space craft some distance away. Its blue,
satiny sides reflected the glow of thousands of
lights on the field. Red smoke still curled up into
the night, warning of the approach of blast-off time.
And yet there was still a little while to go, for the
spiderwebs of the gantry cranes still hugged the
sides of the three-stage space vessel. Workmen
were swarming all over the platforms, making last-minute
checks on the ship.</p>
<p>There was a high wire fence around the <i>Orion</i>
and only one entrance through it. A uniformed official
was checking tickets as the passengers went
through the gate. The official checked Officer Mulroy&rsquo;s
ticket, and Mr. Mulroy told him it would be
all right for the boys to help him carry his baggage
aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The boys&rsquo; new friend took them down some steps
into a concrete tunnel that led to the launching pad.
On the way they stopped at a little room where
Mr. Mulroy was weighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weight is a very important factor on a space
ship,&rdquo; Mr. Mulroy said, as they were on their way
again.</p>
<p>The tunnel led to an elevator that ran up the side
of the rocket. The elevator cab rose and rose, high
into the black night. Finally, Officer Mulroy pressed
a button and said this was where they were to get
off.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch followed their friend out into
a corridor of the space ship. Officer Mulroy
searched the doors they passed, then recognized
his own, Stateroom 17. He drew out a key and
unlocked the door, then preceded the boys into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, what a tiny room!&rdquo; Patch exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to be this small,&rdquo; Mr. Mulroy said. &ldquo;Every
inch of area on a space ship is at a premium, you
know. For most travelers, the Von Braun Space Station
is only a stopover on a longer trip into space.
Sometimes the layover is for several days or even
a week or two. Since rooms aboard the space station
are very limited, most of the passengers are
quartered in staterooms in the rocket in which
they left earth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Suddenly, a voice came over a speaker in the
room: &ldquo;Blast-off in ten minutes. All nonpassengers
are requested to leave the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us,&rdquo; Garry said unhappily.</p>
<p>How he envied Officer Mulroy on his coming
trip into the deeps of space! He wanted to go so
badly that his heart ached. But he realized that not
for many years could his fondest dream come true.</p>
<p>Officer Mulroy noticed Garry&rsquo;s reluctance to
leave, and placed a friendly arm around his shoulder.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so hard, Garry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Be the
very best student you can. The years will go by
fast, and then one day you will wake up to find that
you are eligible to be a spaceman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Garry said, trying to smile convincingly,
although he did not feel happy. The idea of
the future did not interest him now, but only the
present, because the queen of the spaceways was
about to blast off, and he wanted so desperately
to remain aboard her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Garry,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to
get Officer Mulroy into trouble by us being caught
aboard at blast-off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Officer Mulroy said with a smile.
&ldquo;Being a stowaway on a rocket is really a serious
matter. You see, for every pound of pay load on a
rocket, there must be many more pounds of fuel,
so if an extra person remained aboard, the ship
might not be able to reach its destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for letting us come aboard with you,
Mr. Mulroy,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll remember what
you told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The space officer insisted on tipping the boys,
and it was a generous tip at that. As the two left the
room he called to them, &ldquo;Good-by, fellows. I&rsquo;ll send
you a post card from Mars. That&rsquo;s a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry and Patch said good-by and followed the
directions that Officer Mulroy had given them for
leaving the ship.</p>
<p>Garry pressed the button of the elevator in which
they had ridden earlier. As the doors parted and
he and Patch went in, he said to his friend, &ldquo;Gee,
I hate to leave. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with
me, Patch. Maybe I&rsquo;m just tired of having to do the
same thing every day, over and over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel kind of the same way, Garry,&rdquo; Patch admitted,
&ldquo;but I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to sweat out the
old grind for a few more years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had no sooner started to descend than the
light in the elevator went off, and then the elevator
itself stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on!&rdquo; Garry exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power&rsquo;s off!&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<p>Presently, the light came on again, and the boys
felt a lot better.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew, for a minute I was scared!&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too. Hey, we&rsquo;re still not moving, though!&rdquo;
Garry pressed harder on the button, but the elevator
refused to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck here, Garry!&rdquo; Patch burst out.</p>
<p>Garry started banging furiously on the walls of
the elevator. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to make ourselves
heard, Patch!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The din was very loud in the cramped compartment,
as both boys hammered on the wall.</p>
<p>No one came to their rescue, but then a voice
spoke over the public-address speaker in the ceiling
of the elevator: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, folks. A
short circuit in the fuel-pump relay caused us to
lose electric power momentarily. But everything
has been restored to normalcy. Warning: Three
minutes to blast-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>hasn&rsquo;t</i> been restored!&rdquo; Garry burst out desperately.</p>
<p>The boys pounded on the metal walls until their
knuckles hurt.</p>
<p>In a final desperate action, Garry slammed his
closed fist against the stubborn power button. Instantly,
he felt the elevator throb underfoot and
begin to descend once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; Garry breathed prayerfully.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve still got to hurry in order to get off in
time! No telling how long we&rsquo;ve been stuck in this
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the elevator stopped, the doors slid open
and the boys ran out. But they found themselves in
a strange corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not out of the ship yet!&rdquo; Garry exclaimed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only gone down a deck or two.
The elevator must still be fouled up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do now?&rdquo; Patch asked in desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back into the elevator and try to get to the
ground. We&rsquo;ll have to hurry! The elevator is part
of the gantry crane, and it&rsquo;ll be rolled away any
moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rushed back to the closed doors of the
elevator. But a sign in red lights on the door read:
&ldquo;DO NOT ENTER. ELEVATOR REMOVED.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve already taken it away!&rdquo; Patch said in
dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find a place to strap down, or every
bone in our bodies will be broken on the blast-off!&rdquo;
Garry said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>A speaker along the corridor next gave out with
the dread words: &ldquo;Blast-off in ninety seconds,
ladies and gentlemen. Secure your seat harness and
listen to the instructions of the stewards. Failure
to obey directions could cost you your lives. In the
first few moments of acceleration in a rocket ship,
there is a crushing blow to the human body. This
jolt will occur twice more as the second and third
stages blast off. For that reason, it is absolutely
necessary that everyone be strapped down securely
to his G-couch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch grabbed his friends arm in a fierce grip.
&ldquo;Garry, we&rsquo;re going to die! We&rsquo;re going to die!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>Garry shook off Patch and desperately began
throwing open doors along the corridor, looking
into one room after another. &ldquo;There must be some
G-couches along here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I read somewhere
that space law says there must be emergency
couches on all decks of a rocket ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch tagged along after Garry, complaining.
Garry could not afford to be sympathetic now. Both
their lives depended on what he did within the next
minute.</p>
<p>Then Garry found it. Printed on the door was the
heartening word: &ldquo;G-COUCHES.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung open the door and saw a row of six S-shaped
reclining seats.</p>
<p>Garry grabbed the arm of his quaking friend in a
tight grip and told him, &ldquo;Listen to me, Patch, and
do what I tell you. Jump on a couch just as fast as
you can and don&rsquo;t waste a second getting those
buckles fastened across your chest, body, and legs.
Now get going!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Garry helped him along with a shove, then dove
for one of the couches close by.</p>
<p>As he hastily fastened his own straps in place,
Garry cast worried glances at his friend, who was
fumbling as best he could in his nervous state.</p>
<p>A speaker warned of the passing moments: &ldquo;Zero
minus twenty seconds, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen,
sixteen....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few seconds more, and Garry&rsquo;s straps were securely
fastened. He twisted his head to see how
Patch was doing. Patch had almost all his straps in
place, but he could not seem to get the chest
buckle tightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Patch, please hurry!&rdquo; Garry cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m doing the best I can,&rdquo; Patch said, and
Garry could see the streams of sweat trickling down
his round face.</p>
<p>Then, with a final lucky tug, Patch had it. Turning
his weakly smiling face to Garry, he murmured,
&ldquo;Garry, I guess I just barely did....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry never heard the rest of the words, for at
that moment the <i>Orion</i> shook herself like a big dog,
began a slow tug upward into the black night, and
then, a few seconds later, with a deafening roar
tore free of her earthly bonds and flung herself
into space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c3"><br />3. STOWAWAYS IN SPACE</h2>
<p>Garry had read about the rough effects of blast-off,
but the real thing was even worse than he had imagined.
He felt like one of those characters in movie
cartoons who gets flattened to the thickness of
paper when run over. His lungs felt as though they
had collapsed, and he could suck in only the barest
trace of breath.</p>
<p>But the discomfort did not last long. His body
seemed to fill out like an inflated balloon, although
he still felt the ache of having been nearly
squashed. His stomach felt as though it had been
stirred up with an egg beater, and his head swam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>But no sooner had he recovered from the first
violent thrust than it came again as the rocket&rsquo;s second
stage began firing. Then the crushing pressure
eased once more, only to return once again as the
third stage, the occupied section of the <i>Orion</i>, began
firing away. When this force let up, Garry knew
it was the last.</p>
<p>The ship did not appear to be moving, but
Garry knew it must be traveling many thousands
of miles an hour.</p>
<p>Garry&rsquo;s shaky hands groped for the belts of the
harness that snugly fitted his body. He worked the
buckles loose from his upper body and sat up on his
G-couch. He did not release his legs, because he
was already feeling the dizzying effects of weightlessness.
He looked across at Patch on the next
couch.</p>
<p>Patch was still lying flat, and his face was
pasty white. His eyes were closed, and this alarmed
Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch!&rdquo; Garry called, repeating the name over
and over.</p>
<p>Patch had blacked out, but after a few minutes
he came back to consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; Patch asked in a weak
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in space, Patch,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
probably think we&rsquo;re stowaways and send us to
jail. Maybe Officer Mulroy will get in trouble too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>But this was the least of Patch&rsquo;s worries
right now. He put his hand to his head, complaining,
&ldquo;Gee, I feel terrible. Everything&rsquo;s going
around! And I had the worst nightmare all night
long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry had to grin at this. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been here
all night, just a few minutes. It just seems like a
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch fumbled loose his upper straps and struggled
to a sitting position, but fell back down onto
his contour seat. &ldquo;Wow, I can&rsquo;t make it!&rdquo; he said
thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use trying to get up,&rdquo; Garry said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re weightless and would never be able to get
about. It&rsquo;s funny how I wanted so terribly to go
into space, but now that I&rsquo;m out here I&rsquo;m not enjoying
it. I guess it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m afraid of what&rsquo;s
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry wondered what they should do. Should
they turn themselves in and take their chances on
being believed that their being aboard the <i>Orion</i>
was due to an accident? But if they did this, then
Mr. Mulroy might be held responsible for not seeing
that the boys had left the ship. And yet, Garry
realized, he and Patch could not stay in hiding indefinitely.
Sooner or later they must be found out.
If they did not turn themselves in, and they were
discovered, they would surely be regarded as stowaways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Then a new fear came to Garry. What if his
and Patch&rsquo;s combined weight was over the ship&rsquo;s
allowable limit? What if their being aboard would
keep them from reaching the space station and, instead,
cause the earth&rsquo;s gravity to pull the <i>Orion</i>
back down? In that case the two of them could
possibly cost the space-ship line a new rocket worth
millions, not to mention the lives of all the persons
aboard in case a safe landing could not be made!</p>
<p>Garry was occupied with these grave thoughts
until he heard the public-address system saying:
&ldquo;We are now in braking orbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry knew this meant that the ship had
reached the vicinity of the space station and was
beginning to circle the station while the braking
rockets were cut in. This procedure would slow
down the <i>Orion</i> so that she would be moving at
the same orbital speed as the space station. Then it
would be easy for her to slip into dock.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch felt the tug of the ship&rsquo;s gradually
diminishing speed, but this was not nearly as
rough as the blast-off had been. As the <i>Orion</i> moved
into dock, the boys felt their weight returning. This
was due to the station&rsquo;s rotation and artificial
gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks like the ship has made it all right,&rdquo;
Patch said, relieved. &ldquo;They must not have had a
full load.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The boys heard the technical language of the
docking procedure. Garry listened closely, even
though he could not understand much of it. But
this was all part of the spaceman&rsquo;s education, and
he was eager to learn it, even at such a crucial moment
as this.</p>
<p>Yet as he listened, he had another unpleasant
thought. Now that he and Patch had the blot of
&ldquo;stowaway&rdquo; against them, would this misconduct
prevent them from realizing their dream of being
future spacemen?</p>
<p>Finally, the ship&rsquo;s motion stopped altogether.
The <i>Orion</i> had nestled into her dock on the big Von
Braun Space Station, named after the great space
scientist of the past century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where do we go from here?&rdquo; Patch asked,
as the two removed their harness straps and got
to their feet. &ldquo;Garry, I&rsquo;m scared, plenty scared!
Wow, I&rsquo;m a little wobbly too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay put until we hear further announcements
over the speaker,&rdquo; Garry suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
give us time to think this through a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just stalling, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing,
aren&rsquo;t we, Garry? We don&rsquo;t want to turn ourselves
in because we&rsquo;re afraid of what will happen to us,&rdquo;
Patch said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Garry hung his head. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s what it does
amount to, Patch. I keep thinking what this will do
to our hopes of being spacemen. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll
never make it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stayed in hiding for another half hour.
Then Garry said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have something to
live on until we make up our minds what we&rsquo;re
going to do, Patch. I think space ships have emergency-ration
compartments located along the corridors.
I&rsquo;m in favor of looking for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than just waiting here and doing
nothing,&rdquo; Patch agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out and see if the coast is clear,&rdquo;
Garry said.</p>
<p>He looked around outside and then motioned to
Patch. They started off quietly down the corridor,
but after a moment they heard footsteps approaching
from around the corner behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, we&rsquo;ve got to hide!&rdquo; Patch whispered
urgently. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry saw a door up ahead. &ldquo;That leads into an
air lock, Patch. We may be safe in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry turned a wheel on the door, and it swung
open. They found themselves in a short tunnel, at
the other end of which was another door. The air
lock was used for entering and leaving the ship
while it was in space. The spaceman would enter
the chamber and wait for the air pressure to equalize
before he left the air lock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Garry quickly turned another wheel on the inside
of the door, closing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay in here very long without air,&rdquo;
Garry said. &ldquo;The other end of this air lock probably
leads directly into the space station. Shall we try
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This running and hiding has got to end somewhere,&rdquo;
Patch replied with discouragement. &ldquo;Lead
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry checked the pressure gauge on the far
door and saw that there was normal pressure on the
other side. He turned the wheel on the door, and it
swung open. The boys went through, and Garry
wheeled the door shut behind them.</p>
<p>They were in a huge enclosed dock of the space
station. Lined up ahead were several space taxis,
or fliers, which were used for trips outside the
station and also doubled as lifeboats in time of
emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s cold in here!&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main thing, though, is that there&rsquo;s no one
around,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll give us time to collect
our thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you think,&rdquo; Patch whispered, tugging
at Garry&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;There come a couple of men
down that corridor across the way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Garry moved quickly and quietly, pulling Patch
along. As the men entered the dock, the boys
ducked out of sight behind one of the space fliers.</p>
<p>The men approached the flier next to the outer
door of the dock and pressed a button on the taxi&rsquo;s
surface. Its door sprang open, and the men entered
the flier.</p>
<p>They were in there for fully five minutes. During
that time, Garry began to shiver, but it was not
from fright so much as it was the coldness of the
dock. Garry felt Patch shaking beside him and
knew his friend was just as uncomfortable as he.
But they had to stay put. There was no other place
they could go at this moment.</p>
<p>Finally, the men came out of the space taxi,
closed the door, and, to the relief of Garry and
Patch, disappeared up the corridor.</p>
<p>Garry stood up and hugged himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m freezing to death,&rdquo; Patch chattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. We sure can&rsquo;t stay here like this,&rdquo;
Garry replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we try getting into one of these
ships?&rdquo; Patch suggested. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve got heaters
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry pressed the button of the ship which they
had been hiding behind, but the door did not open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power is off or something,&rdquo; Garry groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the first one will open,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;It
worked for those men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Garry went over to the first craft and pressed the
door button. Instantly, the door sprang open. A
tiny air-lock chamber faced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness,&rdquo; Patch murmured. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if the men come back?&rdquo; Garry cautioned.
&ldquo;They may be preparing for a trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are windows facing the corridor,&rdquo; Patch
said. &ldquo;We can keep an eye out for them and duck
for cover again if they return. Gee, let&rsquo;s try it anyhow,
Garry! I feel like a penguin that&rsquo;s lost all its
feathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry agreed and entered the flier, Patch climbing
in behind. A second door led from the air lock
chamber into the flier proper. Besides the pilot&rsquo;s
seat, there were six other seats, three on a side. It
was warmer in here than outside, and Garry felt
heat gently blowing. This made him suspect that
the men had just turned it on and that they were
going to return for a trip in the craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we won&rsquo;t have long to stay in here,&rdquo;
Garry told his friend and mentioned his suspicion
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Patch agreed. &ldquo;Where will
we go from here? Garry, I&rsquo;m tired of running. And
I&rsquo;m getting more scared by the minute because of
what we&rsquo;re doing. Why don&rsquo;t we just turn ourselves
in and face the music, whatever it is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Through a window of the taxi, Garry was watching
the corridor for signs of the returning men. &ldquo;I
guess you&rsquo;re right, Patch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give ourselves
up when those men return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should wait until then,&rdquo; Patch
objected. &ldquo;It will go a lot easier for us if we give
ourselves up voluntarily instead of looking as if we
had been caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Garry agreed, but, as he was reaching
for the button to open the door, he heard a click.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Patch asked in alarm. &ldquo;What
did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;Something was operating
all by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soft purring sound began to be heard inside
the craft, and Garry felt the little ship vibrating
ever so softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch,&rdquo; Garry said tensely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this.&rdquo;
He tried the door button, but it would not work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Patch asked, and there
was fright in his voice.</p>
<p>A movement outside in the dock caught the boys&rsquo;
eyes. Through the wide front port of the ship, they
watched a big door slide open, revealing a dark air-lock
tunnel&mdash;a tunnel large enough to hold the craft
which they were occupying!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; Patch repeated, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Garry slumped into one of the seats, fear numbing
his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know what kind of ship this is, Patch,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s remote controlled, guided by
an operator inside the space station. We&rsquo;re heading
straight out into space, Patch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c4"><br />4. ADRIFT IN THE DEEPS</h2>
<p>Trapped within the space taxi, Garry and Patch
watched the darkness of space enlarge before their
eyes as the ship emerged from the air-lock tunnel
of the space station. The stars about them were
countless lights, some packed so closely together
that they trailed across the sky like distant streaming
veils. But the boys had no eye for their beauty
at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; Patch asked in a dismal voice, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
going to happen to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as they have control of the ship, I guess
we&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;Maybe they are
just sending the ship out on a practice run or possibly
to pick someone up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick someone up?&rdquo; Patch asked, puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of satellite workers or repairmen.
The skies out here are flooded with satellites, you
know. They must have men working on them all
the time,&rdquo; Garry explained.</p>
<p>Garry heard a hissing sound. He found a slit in
the wall from which it was coming. Near the opening
was a gauge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an oxygen mixture coming in,&rdquo; Garry
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably automatic. It turns on whenever
the air pressure drops or becomes fouled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something in our favor,&rdquo; Patch said
grudgingly.</p>
<p>Garry found his feet beginning to lift weightlessly
off the floor. His body sagged off balance, and
he had to hold onto a handle on one of the seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, what&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; Patch exclaimed frantically.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going weightless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look for a wardrobe compartment,&rdquo; Garry
suggested. &ldquo;Since these fliers are used as lifeboats
sometimes, there must be space suits and things.
Maybe we&rsquo;ll find magnetic shoes, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll we ever get around in here to look for
anything?&rdquo; Patch sputtered. By now he was floating,
his legs and arms flailing helplessly like a bug
on its back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Using the handles on the backs of the seats, Garry
worked his way across to a cabinet set in the wall.
Then he moved from the last seat handle to the
wall rail and worked himself down it to the plastic
case. Through the clear window Garry could see
space suits and accessories. He pressed a button,
and the door popped open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in luck, Patch,&rdquo; Garry reported. &ldquo;There
are magnetic shoes in here. I hope the gravity plates
in the floor are working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry managed to pick up two pairs of the shoes,
tucking one pair under one arm. That left one hand
holding the second pair and the other hand free.</p>
<p>Even then, it took quite some doing for him to
work his way across to Patch, who looked like a
pennant floating in the breeze as he hung crossways
in the air, one hand tightly clutching a seat handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, I don&rsquo;t feel so good,&rdquo; Patch complained.
&ldquo;Everything in me feels like its pushing upward.
Even my brain seems to be floating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lack of gravity doing that,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;You
are used to gravity always pulling down on you.
When that pull is gone, it makes you feel as if your
body is moving up. At least that&rsquo;s what all the books
say. And I believe them, because I feel that way
myself. Here are your shoes. They&rsquo;re pretty big, but
they&rsquo;ll be better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, how&rsquo;ll I ever get them on?&rdquo; Patch protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold onto you while you put them on,&rdquo; Garry
offered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll make it easier&mdash;I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Garry got behind Patch and held him by the collar.
Then began Patch&rsquo;s struggles with the shoes.
It was comical for Garry to see his friend having
such a hard time, but he knew Patch would have
the laugh on him later.</p>
<p>It took them both a good while to get the shoes
on. When the floor current of the gravity plates
finally held them down, the boys laughed at each
other in their oversized equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we look like snowshoe rabbits with our
big feet!&rdquo; Patch said with a laugh. &ldquo;Good thing
those straps pulled up tight, or we&rsquo;d never be able
to keep them on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The craft had been moving along smoothly, but
before long it began to shudder irregularly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jets have cut out, Patch,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
coasting. Without any air friction out here in space,
we <i>could</i> coast along forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; Patch gasped.</p>
<p>But Garry found out that his guess was wrong,
and he was glad that it had been. Presently, twin
jets of flame were seen pouring from the front of
the craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, we&rsquo;re on fire!&rdquo; Patch shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re the braking jets,&rdquo; Garry corrected.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re being slowed down, Patch! I think we&rsquo;ll
find out very soon now what our destination is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness for that,&rdquo; Patch replied. &ldquo;You
know, you got me plenty worried when you said
that we might coast forever out here. Although after
about a hundred years I probably wouldn&rsquo;t mind
any longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Patch,&rdquo; Garry cried. &ldquo;Up ahead&mdash;a satellite!
That must be where we&rsquo;re headed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they approached, the craft still being slowed
by the braking jets, Garry and Patch took in the
scene before them. The satellite itself somewhat
resembled a giant radio speaker. Its largest area
was a huge reflecting surface, and this surface was
made up of adjustable panels that could be banked
in any direction. The boys could see around the side
of the satellite, and backing up the front broad surface
was a block-shaped structure with windows.</p>
<p>As the tiny space craft drew closer, the boys saw
a hatch open in the rear structure, and two men in
space suits emerged, holding onto hand rails on
the outside of the satellite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the radio and TV relay satellites,
Patch,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;There are three of them,
spaced equally around the earth, for relaying TV
and radio all over the world. Our ship has probably
been sent out to pick up these men and bring them
back to the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they be surprised when they see us
aboard?&rdquo; Patch remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Garry noticed that the space taxi seemed to be
moving a little off course, and this disturbed him,
especially since one of the forward jets had cut off
but the other hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The craft was veering steadily away from the
satellite and slowing rapidly. Finally, it came to a
dead stop several hundred yards from the satellite,
but then it began backing up. As the craft gained
speed in reverse, Garry and Patch were nearly
knocked off their feet from the acceleration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The front jet is propelling us backward!&rdquo; Garry
cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with the remote
control!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The craft began going into a dizzy spin. The boys
had to hold on tightly to some anchored support to
keep from being flung against the wall.</p>
<p>Garry watched the satellite become lost against
the sprawling background of stars. He knew they
were hurtling farther out into space, out of control,
headed for a destination now that even the space-station
operators might not know.</p>
<p>The boys were so disheartened by the latest bad
break that, for the time being, they did not care
what happened to them. This lowering of their
spirits seemed to remind them that they were a long
time past their slumber time, and they suddenly became
very sleepy. By earth time, it would be the
dark hours before dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>They went to sleep on their feet, because in the
zero gravity there was no need for them to lie down.
Their magnetic soles held them in place to keep
them from drifting about as they slept.</p>
<p>Garry was the first to wake up, hours later. There
was no way for him to know how much time had
passed. He woke his friend, who stretched and
yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d be able to sleep standing
up,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;I feel like a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got a good rest,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s
because of the zero gravity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch looked gloomily out of the front port of
the flier. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still no better off than we were
before, though, Garry, but, I think we have stopped
moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry shook his head. &ldquo;It just seems like we&rsquo;re
not moving because the stars and everything else
around us are so still. We&rsquo;re moving all right&mdash;and
fast. This ship may still be moving after we&rsquo;re dead,
even if we could live for a hundred years, because
there&rsquo;s nothing ever to slow us down out here; that
is, unless we happened to move into the gravity
field of some planet, which would pull us down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew we should have turned ourselves in when
we had the chance,&rdquo; Patch said mournfully. &ldquo;If we
had, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this fix now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault for trying to hold
out so long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, too late now to do anything,&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should give up hope,&rdquo; Garry
said. &ldquo;They might still send out a ship to try to pick
up this one. They know it&rsquo;s lost, but of course they
don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s anybody in it, and they may not
know where to look for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He investigated the sloping wall between him
and the front window. The middle of it was shaped
something like an old-fashioned roll-top desk,
closed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Garry thought to himself. &ldquo;This ship
has been run by remote control until now, but why
shouldn&rsquo;t it have controls of its own? If it does have
them, they should be right here in front of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry&rsquo;s hopes soared again as he ran his hands
over the light-green plastic slope in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A button,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There must be a button
or something that opens this thing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;re you mumbling about?&rdquo; Patch
asked.</p>
<p>Garry was too concerned with what he was doing
to answer his friend. Suddenly, he found something
on the left side of the instrument. It was a
button. He pressed it.</p>
<p>Two covers began swinging open in front of him,
as stage curtains would do, revealing a bank of dials
and levers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch!&rdquo; Garry shouted. &ldquo;Look what!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Patch came clicking over in his magnetic shoes.
&ldquo;Hey, they&rsquo;re instruments for running this crate!
Why didn&rsquo;t we think of looking for them before?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably because we don&rsquo;t know how to operate
them,&rdquo; Garry replied.</p>
<p>There was a half-circle steering wheel that pulled
out, and the boys were sure what this was for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; Patch said happily, &ldquo;the steering wheel&mdash;that
may be all that we&rsquo;ll need! Since the ship is
moving under its own power, all we have to do is
turn her around and head back for the space station.
We can keep circling it until one of the ships
from the station intercepts us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry tried the wheel. It was locked tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that easy, Patch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First we&rsquo;ve
got to find how to unlock the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought not to be hard,&rdquo; Patch replied. &ldquo;A
button or switch....&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both began carefully examining the steering
column and wheel, but did not find anything
that would release the wheel. Then they went over
the console panel very closely. They found switches
and levers that could not be identified, but they decided
to try them anyhow and see what they controlled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>They got no result at first, but, when the fourth
switch was thrown, the console lighted up and the
ship began to throb with a new life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been one of the power levers,&rdquo;
Garry said. &ldquo;Look&mdash;the steering wheel is free! The
power had to be on before it would unlock the
wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry!&rdquo; Patch exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re on our way!
We&rsquo;re on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope my sense of direction is correct,&rdquo; Garry
said, &ldquo;because I can&rsquo;t read those directional meters.
I think we&rsquo;ll be headed in the general direction
of the station if we make a half turn. I remember
the position of that brilliant nebula over there
and also the planet Venus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry was beginning to turn the wheel slowly
for their gradual turnabout in the sky when the
smell of something burning issued from the console.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, something seems to be shorting out,&rdquo; Patch
said in alarm. &ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s smoke coming from
the panel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had he spoken than there was a small
explosion inside the console, a strong odor of ozone
filled the boys&rsquo; nostrils, and all the lights went out.
But what was worse, the steering wheel froze in
Garry&rsquo;s hands and locked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch, we&rsquo;re ruined!&rdquo; Garry groaned loudly. &ldquo;I
must have done something wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Garry put his hands over his face in despair.
&ldquo;Patch, we were so close, so very close....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like something just doesn&rsquo;t want us to
get out of this alive,&rdquo; Patch said bitterly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
jinxed, Garry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do no good to start feeling sorry for ourselves
again,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;Remember, we thought
we were goners before. Something may turn up to
save us&mdash;something maybe like a Good Samaritan
flying around in a space ship just looking for wandering
boys. But how many of those do you think
you would find in all the millions of miles of space
that surround us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Garry stood upright, staring intently
straight out the forward port. &ldquo;Speaking of Good
Samaritans, Patch, that might not be so farfetched
after all. Look out there, straight ahead. There&rsquo;s a
light moving against the stars. It just might be a
space ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; Patch said, with a trace of hope returning,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s most likely a Sputnik or Tiros or some
other satellite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Its movement isn&rsquo;t perfectly
straight. I&rsquo;m sure I just saw it change direction as if
heading this way. Patch, if you&rsquo;ve ever prayed, do
it now. The next few minutes may decide whether
we live or die out here in space!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c5"><br />5. A &ldquo;FLYING TIN CAN&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The boys watched intently as the object neared
them. Although it was still pretty far off, they knew
that it was not a true celestial object, because they
could determine already that it was shaped like
nothing usually found in space. In fact, it looked
remarkably like a tin can! It was an odd shape for a
space ship, but the boys were sure that was what it
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not like anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen!&rdquo; Garry
said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve seen all kinds of pictures of space
ships in magazines and books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a special kind of ship,&rdquo; Patch suggested.
&ldquo;But just so it really is a space ship with
living people in it, it can be shaped like a barbecue
pit for all I care!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Patch!&rdquo; Garry said in a stricken voice. &ldquo;What if
it&rsquo;s from another planet and carries strange people?
Maybe even <i>unfriendly</i> passengers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch&rsquo;s eyes shone like bright marbles. &ldquo;Gee, you
don&rsquo;t really think so, do you? I&mdash;I mean, how could
it be possible? We&rsquo;ve already explored Mars and
Venus, and those planets aren&rsquo;t inhabited. How
could anything possibly live on those big cold planets
farther out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they are from another star,&rdquo; Garry said
in a solemn tone.</p>
<p>They would know pretty soon where the flying
object was from, because it was still heading in
their direction, and its passengers could not possibly
miss seeing them.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch were silent as the object drew
steadily closer, each of them engrossed in his own
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really does look like a tin can,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;A
tin can with a big eye in front! But what a big tin
can! It&rsquo;s big as one of those ancient dirigibles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch, I can begin to make out some writing
over the eye. See it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Just a moment. It&rsquo;s coming into focus. It
says &lsquo;CAREFREE!&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know what it means,
but it <i>sounds</i> friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the name of it,&rdquo; Garry suggested.
&ldquo;No ship with a name like that could be carrying
unfriendly passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It also means that there must be earthmen
aboard, because it&rsquo;s an earth word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have anything to worry about,
Patch,&rdquo; Garry said confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re turning around,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re
pulling even with us. I guess they&rsquo;ll anchor
to us with magnetic grapples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully, the <i>Carefree</i> edged closer so that it
could latch on. The big circular space ship dwarfed
the tiny taxi so greatly that it seemed like David
and Goliath.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch heard a soft bump as the <i>Carefree</i>
coupled onto the side of their craft on which
the door was located. Garry knew now that the
ships were joined as one.</p>
<p>Garry looked at Patch, and Patch looked at Garry.
They knew all they had to do now was open the air
locks between the ships. But they hesitated as if
there were still some doubt in their minds as to the
friendliness of those in the other space ship.</p>
<p>There came a rap on their air-lock door. Once
again Garry looked at Patch, and Patch looked at
Garry. Then, after another few moments of hesitation,
Garry shrugged and clicked over to the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well open up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whether or
not they&rsquo;re friendly, they&rsquo;ve certainly got the upper
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry pressed the button that controlled the
outer door of the air lock. Then he pressed another
that opened the inner door.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch looked through the double air
locks into the face of a man who wore a small, neat
white beard. He appeared to be in his early sixties,
and he was clinging to a webbing of ropes that completely
covered the walls of a giant tube or tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; the man said, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Garry and Patch replied together. And
they smiled too, because they were very glad that
it was an earthman who faced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I didn&rsquo;t expect to find a couple of
boys alone in here,&rdquo; the man went on. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened
to the adults with you? You didn&rsquo;t heave
them out the waste hatch, did you?&rdquo; The elderly
man laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, no, Sir,&rdquo; Garry replied with hesitation.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been by ourselves ever since this flier left
the Von Braun Space Station. It&rsquo;s a pretty long
story, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name is Captain Eaton, boys.&rdquo; The man
winked at them, showing his white teeth in another
smile. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not really a space captain. I
wouldn&rsquo;t deceive you. The <i>Carefree</i> is a private
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
ship, and the men call me &lsquo;Captain&rsquo; because I&rsquo;m the
owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton&rsquo;s dark, alert eyes flickered over
the interior of the flier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought whoever was in this ship must be in
some sort of trouble,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because of your erratic
flight. That&rsquo;s why we latched onto you, to see
if we could be of some help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>do</i> need help, Captain,&rdquo; Patch said earnestly.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the first thing about running
this thing. We had just about given ourselves
up for lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did you get into such a spot
as this?&rdquo; Captain Eaton asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir,&rdquo; Garry explained, lowering his eyes,
&ldquo;you see, we&rsquo;re stowaways, although we&rsquo;ve been
able to escape being caught all this time. We didn&rsquo;t
<i>mean</i> to be stowaways, Captain. We were helping
an officer aboard the <i>Orion</i> with his gear, and the
rocket blasted off before we could get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll bet your parents are worried to death
about you,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; Patch answered. &ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;re orphans,
and we lived in an orphanage back in the
United States.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; the elderly man replied, stroking his
short, snowy beard. Then suddenly he grinned
broadly. &ldquo;Well, fellows, how would you like to be
rescued?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all for it!&rdquo; Garry answered, and Patch
nodded his head vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come aboard then. The <i>Carefree</i> welcomes
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the flier?&rdquo; Garry asked. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want to be charged with stealing a space craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Ben Dawes come aboard and set her
adrift toward the satellite so that she can be picked
up easily,&rdquo; the captain said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we blew something out when we tried
to start her,&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben&rsquo;s a genius,&rdquo; Captain Eaton replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
get her to running, no matter what&rsquo;s wrong with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this taken care of, the boys were anxious to
board the <i>Carefree</i> and see if her interior were as
strange and unusual looking as her outer hull. They
removed their bulky magnetic shoes and entered
the air lock of the <i>Carefree</i>.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton first explained the purpose of the
webbing that lined the walls of the tube.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you boys saw us move in, you probably know
that this is the rear of the ship, and this tunnel is in
the center. It goes the full length of our &lsquo;tin can&rsquo;
and comes out front into the flight deck. We have
to leave and enter the ship through the rear end of
this tube. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; the boys answered together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outer round surface of our &lsquo;tin can&rsquo; revolves
around this center tube as though it were a wheel
around an axis,&rdquo; the captain went on. &ldquo;By so doing,
an artificial gravity is induced along the inside rim
of the &lsquo;can.&rsquo;&rdquo; Captain Eaton frowned. &ldquo;Am I getting
too deep for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Sir,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;The gravity
you are talking about is the result of centrifugal action&mdash;the
same action that makes a ball swing out
on the end of a string when a person swings it
around his head. It&rsquo;s the same kind of artificial gravity
they use on the manned space stations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty sharp, son. I like a boy who doesn&rsquo;t
think that facts belong only in a schoolroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been very interested in space, Sir,&rdquo;
Garry said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;d surprise you with all I know
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would,&rdquo; Captain Eaton admitted.
&ldquo;Say, I don&rsquo;t even know your names. I&rsquo;ve told you
mine. Now let&rsquo;s have yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Garry Coleman,&rdquo; Garry answered, &ldquo;and this
is my best friend, Patch Foster.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Since the center tube of the <i>Carefree</i> was not affected
by the centrifugal force of the rotating &ldquo;tin
can,&rdquo; its gravity was zero. For that reason the webbing
was used to pull oneself along with and not
really for the purposes of climbing and descending.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton turned around on the webbing so
that he could lead the way along the tunnel into the
living quarters of the <i>Carefree</i>. His slim, agile legs
swung free in the zero gravity as he made the turn.
Glossy black space boots covered his feet.</p>
<p>The captain showed Garry where to pull a lever
which closed a series of air-lock doors between the
<i>Carefree</i> and the taxi.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s master and the boys pulled themselves
along the tunnel. Then Captain Eaton stopped and
said, &ldquo;Hold on tightly, fellows. We&rsquo;re going round
and round for a few turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed a lever beneath the webbing, and
Garry felt the tube begin to revolve slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Patch called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to set the tunnel in rotation so that it could
catch up with the rest of the ship, which is always
turning. As soon as you&rsquo;ve become used to the spinning,
we&rsquo;ll go into the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys said they thought they could navigate,
the captain pointed to an open hatch that had
appeared in the wall near them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn around and back down these stairs,&rdquo;
the skipper said. &ldquo;As we descend, the gravity will
become stronger, so that by the time we&rsquo;re at the
bottom we&rsquo;ll be nearly at our earth weights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry and Patch followed their new friend down
the stairs, moving carefully and holding onto the
railing, for they still felt giddy from the rotation of
the central tube. By the time they were at the bottom,
their heads had begun to clear.</p>
<p>That is, they <i>thought</i> their heads had begun to
clear. But no sooner had they gotten this impression
than they became giddy all over again at the
sight that met their eyes. For it was just as if they
had entered a tropical paradise! There were real
flowers in bloom all about, and aquariums full of
live fishes were set into the surrounding walls.</p>
<p>The boys were too surprised to say anything. All
they could do was just stare and stare in disbelief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c6"><br />6. A <i>CAREFREE</i> WORLD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like my garden, fellows?&rdquo; Captain
Eaton asked. &ldquo;It helps keep me from getting homesick.
I used to have a most luxuriant garden back on
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; Garry burst out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as
if we were outdoors on a summer day, it&rsquo;s so real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a goldfish pond, Garry,&rdquo; Patch said,
&ldquo;with lily pads floating on top and a bench beside
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw so many kinds of flowers,&rdquo; Garry
said, &ldquo;and shrubs too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;The flowers and shrubs serve a double purpose,&rdquo;
Captain Eaton explained. &ldquo;They not only provide
homelike pleasure to me and my friends, but they
also help keep the air in the <i>Carefree</i> supplied
with oxygen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;Plants in light
breathe exactly opposite from the way we do. They
breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch stooped down, examining the roots of a
shrub. &ldquo;Hey, the roots aren&rsquo;t growing in soil! How
can they live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plants grow in richly fertilized liquid,&rdquo; the
captain answered. &ldquo;In that way, they can be placed
much closer together. Besides, some of the water
making up the fertilized liquid comes from waste
products within the ship. There are other reasons
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton led the way along the aisle that
ran beside the colorfully lighted aquariums. He
stopped in front of a twenty-gallon tank which was
in the process of being cleaned by two men.</p>
<p>One of them was very tall, over six and a half feet.
He was very thin and appeared to be in his late
fifties. But the oddest thing about him, which made
Garry and Patch stare at him in surprise, was the
fact that he was in the full dress of a butler, complete
with newly starched white shirt and neatly
pressed coat and trousers! Although he was holding
a bucket that was catching water from a draining
aquarium, his clothing wasn&rsquo;t in the least mussed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Captain Eaton saw the boys staring at the tall
gentleman and said, &ldquo;Boys, I want you to meet Mr.
Klecker, the Eaton family butler for many years.
When I decided to set out into space on my permanent
cruise, he would not think of being left behind.
Klecker, this is Garry and this is Patch. They will
be our guests for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Klecker looked at them with heavy-lidded
eyes. Then, bowing, he said in a deep stately voice,
&ldquo;Pleased, young gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to know you, Mr. Klecker,&rdquo; Garry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Patch added.</p>
<p>The other person attending to the fish tank was a
young man. He rose from a squatting position and
smiled at the boys. He had crew-cut black hair and
the kind of happy features which indicate a friendly
nature. He wiped his damp hands on his trousers
and offered a palm to Garry first, then to Patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, boys. I&rsquo;m Ben Dawes. Glad to have you
aboard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It sure is a surprise meeting fellows
as young as yourselves out here in space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably be more of a surprise, Ben, to
know that they are alone,&rdquo; the captain said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really!&rdquo; Ben said. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll bet you two have
a long story explaining that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; Garry answered, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll tell you
when we have lots of time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ben is my right-hand man, whom I wouldn&rsquo;t
part with for all the millions I own,&rdquo; Captain Eaton
said proudly. &ldquo;He could build a space ship out of a
safety pin if he had to. He had a big hand in designing
the <i>Carefree</i>, and he knows every bolt and
rivet in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was interesting to Garry to hear that the captain
was a millionaire. That probably explained how
he could afford to take such a leisurely cruise
through space in something akin to a flying palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Klecker and Ben are changing the water
in this aquarium,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said, &ldquo;how would
you like to meet the rest of my friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would, Sir,&rdquo; Garry replied, &ldquo;but are you
sure you don&rsquo;t have things to do?&rdquo; It was hard for
Garry to believe that as important a person as a millionaire
would be willing to devote so much time to
a couple of orphans who were lost in space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here my time is my own,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said.
&ldquo;Back home there were hundreds of little details
that always had to be attended to, and as I grew
older the grind began to keep me in a state of tension
and boredom. That&rsquo;s when I made up my mind
that I would spend the rest of my life the way that
I wanted to&mdash;without constant interruption and
without ever hurrying. I sold everything I owned
and came into space. That was four years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so interested in space, Captain?&rdquo;
Garry asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;In my early days I had a very keen interest in
space travel. I became a space cadet, but after only
four months&rsquo; service I was hurt, and my injury was
such that I had to give up any thoughts of a future
in the Space Service. But my keen interest in space
stayed with me through the years, and I never gave
up hope of returning to the spaceways. So, you see,
my hope was realized, and here I am as carefree as
the name of my ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you never plan to return to earth, Captain
Eaton, ever?&rdquo; Garry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. In the first place, the <i>Carefree</i>
was built in space and could not stand the atmospheric
friction of an earth return. Of course, I
could get back if I really wanted to. But I don&rsquo;t believe
I want to. My simple life out here is very satisfying.
I never had any children, and my wife is now
dead. No, no close relatives. It takes a little money
to survive out here and pay my friends aboard ship,
but it does not take too much. Yes, this is the good
life, and it is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Captain Eaton paced the boys by a couple of
steps, Garry had to marvel at the youthful stride of
their host. His body was as lean and spare as a man
half his age, and Garry was sure he must have kept
himself in good condition all his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>As the trio left the garden and moved into the
next section, Garry and Patch heard a fine tenor
voice singing a lusty aria from an opera. A quick
study of their surroundings told Garry that they
were in the galley.</p>
<p>As the fragrance of good food reached the boys&rsquo;
noses, they suddenly remembered how hungry they
were. They hadn&rsquo;t eaten since they left the orphanage!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gino you hear,&rdquo; Captain Eaton explained.</p>
<p>The boys presently saw a short, fat little Italian
throwing a huge, flat wad of dough into the air. He
stopped when he saw the boys and grinned so
widely that his eyes disappeared and his mouth
seemed as broad as that of a jack-o&rsquo;-lantern.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton exchanged names so that everyone
quickly knew everyone else. Gino was the ship&rsquo;s
cook, and his full name was Gino Spondini.</p>
<p>Gino kept tossing the dough into the air, and
each time he tossed it up it became thinner and
bigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>bambini</i> chose a good day to come to the
<i>Carefree</i>,&rdquo; Gino said. &ldquo;This is a special day for
good food, only once every two weeks, eh, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Captain Eaton nodded. &ldquo;Unfortunately, there
isn&rsquo;t a grocery store just around the corner, and so
we fill our food room and deep freeze only a few
times a year from the commissary satellite which
supplies food to all the manned satellites around
earth. But when we do have an exceptionally good
meal, we enjoy it even more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re making, Gino,&rdquo; Garry
said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m hungry enough to eat it raw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gino looked shocked. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know pizza
when you see it? Where have you been all your
life, <i>bambino</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gino makes the best pizza pie in the world&mdash;or
should I say the best in the solar system?&rdquo; the captain
said. &ldquo;Now, boys, shall we move on and meet
the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the galley and proceeded on to the next
section within the <i>Carefree</i>, leaving Gino singing
another operatic air. The boys wondered if they
could hold out until lunch time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up ahead of us,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said presently,
after passing through a short hallway, &ldquo;is the dormitory.
Since the dorm is used solely for sleeping, we
made it small so that we could give more area over
to the other parts of the ship where we spend more
of our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry found the dormitory indeed small and
quite simple. There were three-tiered bunks along
the walls, with ladders leading up to the second and
third levels.</p>
<p>The captain smiled. &ldquo;Patch, you seem to be looking
over those bunks carefully to see if you find any
that aren&rsquo;t made up.&rdquo;
Patch blushed. &ldquo;Yes, Sir. I was wondering if....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we have room for you two? Well, breathe easily,
for we do have extras. The ship will sleep
twelve, and special cots can be set up to accommodate
more when necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look cozy,&rdquo; Garry said, &ldquo;but how do you
know when to sleep out here in space, without any
real night or day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We observe a twenty-four-hour day just as they
do on earth. Scientists have found out that space
travelers get along much better if they keep the
same hourly habits to which they are accustomed.
We even simulate the appearance of night, turning
down the lights and observing quiet. You&rsquo;ll find
out that you get sleepy at just the right time and
that you wake the &lsquo;next morning&rsquo; feeling just as refreshed
as you did on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard a stirring in one of the top
bunks. A deeply tanned man with a thick shock of
auburn hair raised up sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Captain,&rdquo; the man said with a yawn.
Then he perked up. &ldquo;Who is it with you, Sir?&rdquo; The
man&rsquo;s accent was a thick Scottish brogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have guests, Mac,&rdquo; the captain replied.
&ldquo;These are Garry and Patch. Fellows, meet Mr. McIntosh,
pilot, navigator, engineer, and what have
you. He likes to be called Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, fellows, glad to have you aboard,&rdquo; Mac said
cordially, then yawned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry we woke you, Mac,&rdquo; the captain said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just about due to relieve Isaac upstairs, Sir.
That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just showing the boys the ship. We&rsquo;ll move
on so you can get dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they left the dormitory to pass into another
hallway, Captain Eaton asked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of
Isaac Newton, haven&rsquo;t you, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Sir,&rdquo; Garry responded eagerly. &ldquo;He
was one of the very greatest scientists. He died a
long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain winked at them. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re going
to meet him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c7"><br />7. A SHOCK IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Captain Eaton&rsquo;s announcement that Garry and
Patch were about to meet Isaac Newton, the great
scientist, filled the boys with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going back to the central tube,&rdquo; the skipper
said, &ldquo;and from there to the navigation room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed a steep staircase, as they had done
earlier. Garry felt the comfortable feel of artificial
gravity leaving him as they went higher. The light-headed,
floating sensation of zero gravity was returning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The captain shoved a lever so that the central
tunnel would start revolving. When a doorway appeared
in the tube, the three climbed through.
Then the rotation of the tunnel was stopped. The
captain then led the boys along the stationary axle
of the <i>Carefree</i>, in the direction opposite from
where they had first entered the ship. The three
pulled themselves along the webbing as their legs
swung free, weightlessly. They reached a platform
outside a door at the nose of the ship. Holding onto
the platform rail, Captain Eaton fished into a cabinet
built into the platform and came out with two
pairs of slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can attach these magnetic-soled slippers to
your shoes, fellows,&rdquo; their host said. &ldquo;Because of
the zero gravity in the navigation room, we have to
use gravity plates. The rest of us wear these attached
to our boots all the time because we are always
going back and forth up here, and they are
light and comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the boys had donned the slippers, Captain
Eaton pressed a button, the door slid open, and the
three of them walked through.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch found themselves in a domed
room, which had a wide front port that looked out
into space. Below the port extended a long instrument
panel, or console, with two seats in front of it,
one of which was occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the flight deck!&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
part that looked like a big eye on the front of the
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The pilot turned around in his swivel seat. He
was a huge, muscular man with rugged features
that suggested he might once have been a vigorous
athlete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, meet Isaac Newton,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said.</p>
<p>Garry could not help but laugh, because this
Isaac Newton looked nothing whatsoever like pictures
of the great scientist. But then Garry remembered
that he was being impolite, and he apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Isaac Newton said good naturedly.
&ldquo;Everybody who ever heard of that scientist
laughs. I&rsquo;ve been defending my name ever since I
was a kid. That&rsquo;s how I got to be a professional
fighter, which I was until I got tired of bashing people
and the good captain took me on as his chauffeur.
I stayed on with him, and he said I could come
into space with him if I wanted to. I&rsquo;ve picked up
navigation since I&rsquo;ve been out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get a name like Isaac Newton?&rdquo;
Patch asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, naturally my father was named Newton,&rdquo;
Isaac explained, &ldquo;and he was also a science teacher.
He wanted me to be a scientist too, and thought he
was helping me by giving me the name of one of
the greatest scientists of all time. But, as I said, I got
into so many fights because of being teased about
my name that I had more practice as a fighter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>He laughed, showing a two-tooth vacancy in
the front of his mouth. &ldquo;Funny thing is that I
might&rsquo;ve been a scientist if I hadn&rsquo;t been given the
name of one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, Isaac Newton turned back to check
on how the ship was running. The captain went
over to converse with him, and this gave the boys
an opportunity to look around the navigation room.</p>
<p>Of particular interest was a huge chart on the
back wall near the entrance. On the map were
countless globes of various sizes, and running
through the globes were long curving lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, do you suppose?&rdquo; Patch asked his
friend.</p>
<p>Garry looked closely at the printed names beside
the round symbols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hermes&mdash;Vanguard II&mdash;Adonis&mdash;Derelict Space
Ship <i>Oberon</i>,&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;These seem to be objects
floating about in space,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the lines
through them must be their orbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very observant, Garry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry looked back and saw that Captain Eaton
had come over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what they are, and we have to
know exactly where each one of them is at all
times,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;If we missed keeping up
with one, we might run into a collision orbit with it,
and then it would be quickly over for all of us. Some
of the objects are asteroids, some man-made satellites,
some large meteor fragments whose orbits we
have already plotted. And a few are derelicts, or
empty shells of what were once proud space liners.
Any one of them could destroy the <i>Carefree</i> if it
should hit us. In fact, a meteor as large as an orange
could wreck us because of the terrific velocity at
which it would strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; Patch said, &ldquo;you must be anxious all the
time about being hit by something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s a risk, of course, but space is so very,
very huge that actually there is little chance of being
hit by anything any larger than a grain of sand.
But of course there is always the chance that someday
the big, unexpected one will come. Still, we
don&rsquo;t worry about it because it would keep us from
enjoying our life in space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton showed the boys some of the other
things in the room. He explained the purpose of
the various dials and switches on the console&mdash;facts
that the boys would have given anything to
know when they were so desperately trying to steer
the space taxi. The skipper of the <i>Carefree</i> told
them that usually there was only one pilot on duty
but that, in case of tricky navigation or on other
special occasions, both Mac and Isaac or Ben would
be on together. The captain added that he was quite
a pilot himself and liked to take over the controls
now and then.</p>
<p>Suddenly chimes were heard over a loud-speaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the signal for us to get ready for lunch,&rdquo;
Captain Eaton said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, fellows, and wash
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mac to shake a leg and get up here to relieve
me, will you, Captain?&rdquo; Isaac asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
starved. It&rsquo;s been a long shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Isaac,&rdquo; the captain promised, and pushed
the button which opened the door.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Garry and Patch sat down
to the best meal they had had in a long time. Not
even Thanksgiving at the orphanage could beat
this, Garry told his friend. The boys had their first
taste of pizza pie, and they were hoping it would
not be their last, especially if Gino was the one who
prepared it. They were sure he was the best chef
in all the solar system.</p>
<p>After lunch the patient Captain Eaton spent most
of the afternoon showing the boys more of the ship.
They saw the gym and swimming pool and the library
filled with many recording tapes and films.
There were also books for those who preferred
reading instead of reclining in a soft contour chair
and listening to tapes over earphones.</p>
<p>As they passed from one section to another, Garry
noticed that the indirect daylight effect, that filled
every part of the <i>Carefree</i>, was fading steadily but
slowly. He asked the captain about this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an automatic control that helps put us in the
mood for night,&rdquo; the skipper said. &ldquo;Remember my
telling you about how much better man works in a
properly spaced twenty-four-hour day? Soon now,
the main lights will be very low, with only an occasional
lamp making things bright. It is just like
the coming of night back at home. You will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The space travelers had only a light snack for
dinner because of the big meal earlier in the day.
Soon afterward, the boys began to yawn and get
sleepy as they watched the artificial daylight continue
to fade. They were looking forward to sleeping
lying down for a change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your minds are telling you it&rsquo;s time for bed,
eh?&rdquo; Captain Eaton said with a laugh. &ldquo;Well, so is
mine. I still haven&rsquo;t shown you the observatory,
which is my favorite spot aboard ship. But that can
wait until tomorrow. Let&rsquo;s go to the dorm and get
you two settled before the fellows in there are ready
to turn out the lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys found all the people they had met today
getting ready for bed. That is, all but two of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac is on pilot duty, isn&rsquo;t he, Captain?&rdquo; Garry
asked. &ldquo;But where is Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Captain Eaton was pulling off his shiny boots. He
may have been the boss of the <i>Carefree</i>, with all the
say-so, but he was not too proud to share the same
sleeping quarters with those whom he called his
&ldquo;friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are always two on duty at night, Garry,&rdquo;
Captain Eaton replied to Garry&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;One
acts as pilot, while the other makes the rounds several
times a night to be sure that the automatic controls
are functioning properly. We all take turns
sharing these duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When everyone had climbed into his bunk and
pulled the covers up, Captain Eaton called out from
his own bunk, &ldquo;Check?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came answering &ldquo;checks&rdquo; from all the fellows,
and the next moment Garry found the room
plunged in darkness.</p>
<p>Within only a few minutes&rsquo; time, Garry began
hearing the quiet breathing of those around him
already in deep sleep. But he was too excited to
drop off just yet. As he lay there staring into the
darkness, he wondered if such a thrilling adventure
as this could really be happening to him and Patch.
Why, only a few hours ago they were in despair
for their very lives. Now a whole new experience
had been opened to them. It was almost as if the
<i>Carefree</i> had been sent by Providence to him and
Patch alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>As Garry&rsquo;s thoughts roved, his eyelids began to
feel heavy and the clutch of sleep was groping for
him. He finally drifted off into slumber, only to
wake&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know how many hours later&mdash;with
a parching thirst. He sat upright in his bunk and
threw back the covers that cloaked him like a sweat-box.
He found that he was breathing heavily and
then suddenly remembered the end of a nightmare
he had been having.</p>
<p>As he sat in the quietness and darkness, he began
to relax, and his heartbeats slowed to normal. But
he was still very thirsty. He remembered that there
was a water fountain in the hallway outside the
dormitory.</p>
<p>Slowly and carefully, so as to make no noise to
disturb the others, Garry left his third-level bunk
and made his way down the metal ladder to the
floor. A dim night light, kept burning all the time,
showed the way to the door. Garry pressed the button,
and the door slid open silently.</p>
<p>Garry went out into the faintly lighted hallway.
He shivered as he made his way along the corridor.
It was not that he was cold but that it was so creepy
and lonesome with everything so quiet. The fountain
was like a white ghost crouching against the
wall a couple of dozen feet away. Garry made his
way toward it. He leaned over it, pressed the lever,
and felt the icy stream against his dry lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he said to himself, and he
drank and drank as though he hadn&rsquo;t had water in
all his lifetime.</p>
<p>When he finally got his fill, he rubbed his sleeve
across his mouth and turned to start back toward
the dormitory.</p>
<p>Then it seemed that all the blood flowed out of
his head in one wild rush. His heart began to thump
rapidly, and his legs went weak.</p>
<p>It was due to a startling sight that faced him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c8"><br />8. GARRY HAS A SCARE</h2>
<p>A huge woman was lumbering toward him down
the dim corridor. There was something strange and
unreal about her face and her awkward movements
that gave Garry chills.</p>
<p>Garry started running. He slammed into the water
fountain, bruising his side. But he kept moving,
and so did the woman stalker.</p>
<p>Garry knew that the corridor was in the shape of
a square and that if he kept turning corners he
would arrive back at the dormitory. He wondered
why a woman should frighten him, and it embarrassed
him when he thought what the others would
say when they found out. But the creature was so
hostile&mdash;and somehow monstrous in her looks&mdash;that
Garry was sure she meant to attack him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>As he ran, Garry did not even look back to see if
his adversary were still in pursuit. Finally, he turned
the last corner and saw the dormitory straight
ahead at the end of the corridor. He looked back
around the corner in the direction from which he
had just come. He&rsquo;d outdistanced her. She wasn&rsquo;t
even in sight.</p>
<p>By now his nerves were a little calmer, although
his heart still drummed faster than usual. He began
walking briskly, every now and then casting a look
back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>There was the dormitory at last. He felt a little
silly now, as he reached for the button to open the
door. He decided that he would not tell the others
of his run and his fright lest they tease him about
the incident. He would just tell them that he had
<i>seen</i> the strange woman but would not reveal the
embarrassing circumstances. He still wondered who
she could be, especially since Captain Eaton had
not even mentioned her before.</p>
<p>Just as Garry pressed the door button, he heard
a metallic clanking behind him.</p>
<p>There was the woman, coming very fast, the dim
lights revealing the dark hollows of her eyes. Garry
saw her tight-lipped mouth, her hugeness&mdash;fully
as tall as Mr. Klecker and almost as broad, it
seemed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The unexpectedness of it caused Garry to cry out
for the first time. As the door of the dormitory slid
back, he scrambled inside, hurriedly pressed the
button closing the door, then sank back against it,
panting.</p>
<p>The bright lights went on in the room. Garry&rsquo;s
eyes blurred in the sudden sharp brilliance. When
they came into focus, Garry saw everyone sitting
straight up in their bunks, their eyes squinting and
staring at him in amazement.</p>
<p>After a few tense moments, Captain Eaton asked
from his bunk, &ldquo;Garry, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman&mdash;a big woman&rsquo;s out there!&rdquo; he
blurted. &ldquo;She was after me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry heard the men begin to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, that&rsquo;s Katrinka,&rdquo; the captain explained.
&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a thing. She <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>. She&rsquo;s not
<i>built</i> that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>built</i> that way?&rdquo; Garry echoed. &ldquo;What do
you mean? She&rsquo;s built pretty strong I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton chuckled. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a robot, Garry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A robot!&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why she looks
so different!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I made her as lifelike as possible,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton went on, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m no Michelangelo
as a sculptor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>built</i> her?&rdquo; Garry asked in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We needed someone to do our chores&mdash;you
know, the things that men dislike doing in the
nature of housework and cleaning up. But she&rsquo;s
quite controllable, Garry. She wouldn&rsquo;t have
harmed you. Something must have slipped in her
mechanism so that she became activated. It happens
once in awhile. I&rsquo;ll go take a look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to go far, Sir,&rdquo; Garry said, rubbing
away the sweat that had gathered on his forehead.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right outside the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the captain climbed from his bunk and
slipped into his robe, Garry avoided the eyes of the
others in the dormitory. He had done just what he
had hoped he would not do&mdash;shown his fear of a
harmless robot. He knew they must think him
squeamish, but they were not laughing now.</p>
<p>Patch seemed to have been the only one who was
not aroused by the excitement. Garry could see that
he was still asleep in his bunk.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton passed Garry, opened the door,
and went outside. Garry followed a few steps behind.</p>
<p>The robot still looked menacing to Garry. It
stood, big and dark and unmoving, in the dimness
of the corridor.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton faced Katrinka and spoke in a
clear, loud voice: &ldquo;Closet! Closet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry heard a humming sound coming from the
robot. It shuffled about slowly on its ponderous
feet and started walking away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s obeying!&rdquo; Garry gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Captain Eaton replied.
&ldquo;Probably just a crossing of the wires in her
mechanical brain that activated her. Maybe a slight
lurch of the ship did it. I&rsquo;ll look her over
thoroughly in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you did it,&rdquo; Garry said, still
amazed. &ldquo;How can a machine like that take orders
like a person, just as if it had a brain like us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katrinka&rsquo;s brain is made up of electrical impulses
in certain codes,&rdquo; Captain Eaton replied.
&ldquo;There is a code disk for everything that she is able
to do. For instance, there is one for making up the
bunks, every step in that operation. There&rsquo;s one for
washing the dishes, mopping the floor, and so on.
When I have the time, I make her even smarter by
adding new codes and duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all you said was the word &lsquo;closet,&rsquo; and off
she went,&rdquo; Garry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the code for her heading for the closet
down the corridor where she stays when we have
no need for her. When she goes inside the closet, an
automatic switch will cut off her mechanism, and
she will remain dormant until we need her. Just as
if I gave you an order to go somewhere and your
muscles would carry you to that place, so it is
with Katrinka. The code words I give her activate
the wires that control her movement in a certain
way, whatever that activity is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Garry nodded. &ldquo;I understand it, but it sure must
be a complicated thing the way she works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated, all right,&rdquo; Captain Eaton
agreed. &ldquo;Katrinka represents many years of scientific
study, long before I ever thought of venturing
into space. It was a hobby of mine, in between my
duties as a teacher and head of a space shipping
corporation. My first models were very clumsy and
crude, but I have developed them over the years
and have finally come up with Katrinka, my finest
yet. Many people are interested in her&mdash;manufacturers
and the government too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Garry told Patch about Katrinka,
and Captain Eaton gave them permission
to watch him check out the robot.</p>
<p>After breakfast the three went to the closet where
the robot was kept. The captain pressed the door
button, and the door slid open, revealing the hulking
monster that had frightened Garry the night
before. Even now, Garry felt chills along his spine.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton spoke one word, &ldquo;Follow,&rdquo; and
then turned on his heel, heading on down the corridor.
The boys tagged along and were amazed to
see and hear Katrinka clomping behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> following, Garry!&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, and I still don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; his friend
replied, with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the easiest command of all I&rsquo;ve given
her to do,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said. &ldquo;The word &lsquo;follow&rsquo;
activates a sort of radar device in her and makes
her follow the closest moving object. I believe
that was what happened when she chased you last
night, Garry. Something slipped, causing her to follow
that particular action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain chuckled. &ldquo;She could have pursued
you all night, but she never would have come
closer than three feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Carefree</i>&rsquo;s skipper entered a doorway leading
off the corridor. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my workshop. I&rsquo;ll have
a look at Katrinka&rsquo;s workings now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The shop was untidy, cluttered from top to bottom
with electronic parts, tools, and metal plates.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton gave Katrinka the command to
stop and then with a screw driver removed a large
plate from her back. He nosed about inside the
robot for several minutes, making adjustments
within the complicated network of wires and miniature
parts. Then he replaced the plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a couple of wires got too close,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be chasing you any more, Garry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; Garry replied with a nervous
smile. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go through that again,
even if she <i>is</i> harmless!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how I build commands into her
system,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a simple
command, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;Have her lift up Patch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch backed off hastily. &ldquo;Oh no you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he
objected.</p>
<p>The master of the <i>Carefree</i> laughed. &ldquo;Be a sport,
Patch. She&rsquo;s very gentle. She won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Patch thought a moment, then replied, &ldquo;Okay, if
you promise it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; the captain said, and he set to work.</p>
<p>He brought out tools and equipment of every
kind. Then he removed some plates from various
parts of the robot&rsquo;s body. But instead of tinkering
around inside, as he had done before, he opened up
a big chart and began working from it, using pencil
and paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Captain?&rdquo; Garry asked
after a few moments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a map of Katrinka&rsquo;s system, like the diagram
of a radio or TV,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I have to
figure out what connections I must bring together.
You see, I must give her several actions that make
up the command we have given her. There must be
the action of walking over to Patch, of bending certain
parts that serve as her muscles, and finally the
action of lifting him up. Then I must activate these
through the use of spoken words.&rdquo; The captain
worked for about an hour. The last thing he did
was to take a small disk out of stock and drill holes
in it at very carefully measured positions. Then he
slipped the disk into place inside the robot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s try her out,&rdquo; the captain said.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton faced the robot and spoke in a
loud clear voice: &ldquo;Lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch remained where he stood, but Garry could
see that he was a little nervous as Katrinka began
lumbering toward him. The robot stooped over
and lifted the boy in her big metal arms. She stood
motionless, holding him in a firm grip as Patch began
to struggle impatiently after about fifteen
seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her to put me down, Captain,&rdquo; Patch
begged.</p>
<p>The captain winked at Garry mischievously. &ldquo;My
goodness, Patch, I forgot to give her a command to
release you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch began struggling vigorously, but he could
not escape the robot&rsquo;s iron grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, somebody, get me out of this!&rdquo; Patch cried,
his face reddening from his exertions.</p>
<p>Seeing that his fun had gone far enough, Captain
Eaton barked out, as if he were a military commander:
&ldquo;Atten-tion!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The robot&rsquo;s arms slipped straight down to her
sides, and her body stiffened rigidly. Patch tumbled
unharmed to the floor.</p>
<p>Patch sat up. He turned and looked up at Garry
and the captain. Fear still showed in his eyes, but,
as he saw the playful smile on the captain&rsquo;s face, a
grin spread over his own.</p>
<p>The captain laughed out loud. Then Garry joined
in.</p>
<p>Finally, Patch himself began laughing, having
enjoyed the harmless experiment even if the captain
<i>had</i> played a little joke on him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c9"><br />9. SATELLITE ZONE</h2>
<p>Although Ben seemed to be one of the busiest persons
aboard the <i>Carefree</i>, he still took time out to
chat with the boys early that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been at the orphanage all your lives?&rdquo;
Ben asked Garry and Patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost that long,&rdquo; Garry replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our parents were good friends,&rdquo; Patch added.
&ldquo;All four of them were killed at one time in a
rocket-plane crash near Salt Lake City. We were
only three then and were placed in the orphanage
at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been in space, Ben?&rdquo; Garry
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about eight years now, off and on. I started
when I was in my teens. I was a sort of cabin boy
aboard the old Mars exploration ship, the <i>Jules
Verne</i>. We spent a year there. Boy, what a life! It
was like living in a deep freeze. Since then I&rsquo;ve
traveled to Venus, Luna&mdash;the moon, you know&mdash;and
there&rsquo;s no counting the trips I&rsquo;ve made among
the satellites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get in with Captain Eaton and the
<i>Carefree</i>?&rdquo; Patch wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few years ago I took time to go to school and
learn space-ship engineering and design,&rdquo; Ben replied.
&ldquo;My teacher was Captain Eaton&mdash;or Professor
Eaton, as he was called then. He was also a
millionaire and president of Space Shipping Incorporated.
He helped build the sturdiest ships ever
to fly the solar system. I graduated stone broke and
had to go back to flying the spaceways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d never be an engineer or designer,
but then Professor Eaton got in touch with me and
said he was going to design a space ship for his own
use. He said I was the best pupil he had ever taught
and asked if I would work with him on the project.
Of course I jumped at the idea. We assembled the
ship out here in space, and I&rsquo;ve been with him ever
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Eaton is a grand person, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Garry
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>A fond look came into Ben&rsquo;s dark eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the wisest, kindest, and most generous person I&rsquo;ve
ever known or heard about. You may think he selfishly
spends all his money for his own enjoyment
as he cruises the spaceways, but that isn&rsquo;t the case.
He gives far more than he spends out here to
charities and churches back on earth. And he has
built countless scientific libraries, but he&rsquo;s too
modest to let them be named after himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Carefree</i> is such a big ship, Ben,&rdquo; Patch
said, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t understand how it can be run by
so few men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s due to the captain&rsquo;s genius,&rdquo; Ben explained.
&ldquo;Practically everything you can think of is automatic,
and our batteries are constantly recharged
by sunlight. Of course, once in a while something
goes wrong, and we have to dock at a repair satellite.
And we also have to refuel about every six
months at a service station. But we don&rsquo;t use very
much fuel ordinarily because we mostly just cruise
about in the &lsquo;satellite zone,&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben had to go back to work, and the boys joined
Captain Eaton in the library, where he was waiting
for a TV newscast to come on.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch got the shock of their lives at the
first feature to come over the telecast. For the subjects
were <i>themselves</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>They quickly discovered that they were the most
celebrated missing persons on earth. The orphanage
had first reported their absence, and then Mr.
Mulroy had given his version of their disappearance.
It seemed that Mr. Mulroy was in very hot
water because he had not made sure that the boys
had gotten off the <i>Orion</i> before the blast-off. In
fact, he was in such hot water that he faced court-martial
unless Garry and Patch were found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess the vacation is over, Patch,&rdquo;
Garry said sadly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let Mr. Mulroy be
court-martialed for what we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to tell them where we are, haven&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; Patch replied. &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;d give <i>anything</i>
to stay aboard the <i>Carefree</i>&mdash;that is, if Captain
Eaton would have us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like nothing better than to have you two stay
on,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;But you must consider Mr.
Mulroy and all the police forces who are working
to uncover the mystery of your disappearance.
Right, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; they both agreed reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make full use of the time left you to
finish seeing the marvels of the <i>Carefree</i>. I said I&rsquo;d
show you the observatory today. What do you say
we go there now? I&rsquo;ve got some double-star photos
I want to check on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys liked the idea and went with their host
along the zero-gravity tunnel toward the observatory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The observatory was a &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; attached to the
<i>Carefree</i>&rsquo;s center tube or axle, just a short distance
from the air lock through which Garry and Patch
had first entered the ship. The observatory was such
that it never rotated with the tube or the rest of the
ship. In this way its telescopes could always keep
focus on objects in space.</p>
<p>Three pairs of magnetic shoes clicked along the
metal floor of the observatory as Captain Eaton led
the boys to the reflector telescope, whose big six-inch
eye was pointed out into space. Captain Eaton
looked over a camera which was attached to the
eyepiece of the telescope. Then he unfastened the
camera and took it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picture has been exposed long enough,&rdquo;
the skipper said. &ldquo;It takes a pretty long time for a
photograph to be made in the heavens, you know.
But when you give it full exposure, it shows you
much more than your naked eye can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry studied a satellite chart on the wall. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know there were so many satellites whirling
around the earth. So many different kinds and sizes
too!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are many more than one would imagine,&rdquo;
the captain agreed. &ldquo;Here, let me show
you some of them on the chart. The pictures you
see are exactly the way each satellite looks, and
they are all drawn in proportion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Garry and Patch studied the chart with its multitude
of different shapes and sizes. There were satellites
that resembled drums and others like round
balls. Some were torpedo shaped, and some were
circular and flat like &ldquo;flying saucers.&rdquo; There were
giant satellites, wherein people lived and worked,
and many of them were in the shape of huge revolving
wheels. Some of them had no regularity at all,
appearing to Garry to resemble more than anything
else huge space insects, bristling with antennas and
sun mirrors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you probably know, fellows,&rdquo; Captain Eaton
said, &ldquo;the Von Braun Space Station is our largest
satellite of all. But there are a few others that approach
it in size. For example, here is Quartermaster
10, the biggest of the depot satellites that furnish
supplies to men who live in the world of the artificial
moons. Here is a big fueling satellite, and over
here is another big one&mdash;Spaceharbor&mdash;which is
really a network of smaller moons joined together.
This is a shipyard satellite where space ships are
built and repaired. The <i>Carefree</i> was built in Spaceharbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, with so many of those things orbiting earth
every minute of the day, it seems that space ships
are always in danger of hitting one of them,&rdquo; Patch
remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a very real danger,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said,
&ldquo;especially for us, since we usually cruise in that
area above earth called the &lsquo;satellite zone.&rsquo; For this
reason, every person on pilot duty is responsible
for knowing the position of every satellite within
dangerous range of the <i>Carefree</i>. This requires constant
study and figuring of orbit paths. It really is
the biggest job the pilot has to do, because generally
the <i>Carefree</i> is on automatic pilot and runs itself,
you might say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are some of these smaller satellites?&rdquo;
Garry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there, there, and there are some of the observation
satellites called &lsquo;Tiros.&rsquo; They are used to
photograph part of the earth for different reasons.
Some of the reasons are prediction of weather,
mapping, and for military purposes to see that the
countries of the world do not start arming themselves
for aggression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tiros moons were first put into orbit in the
1960&rsquo;s, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Garry asked.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton nodded. &ldquo;Also these, Garry&mdash;the
Transit satellites, which are used for navigation,
both in space and on earth. This odd-looking little
moon over here is one I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard about.
It is WAS, which means weather-alteration satellite.
Know what it does?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s used to seed storm
clouds with chemicals. If the seeding works, hurricanes
and tornadoes can be broken up before they
cause damage. I believe they were first put into orbit
in the late 1960&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; the captain complimented. &ldquo;Of
course there are many other kinds of man-made
moons, some too technical to explain. But, in spite
of their great number and complexity, each has its
use, and they are a tribute to man&rsquo;s great achievements
in the world of science. One of our big jobs
aboard the <i>Carefree</i> is to see that they remain in
orbit, doing their duty for the people of earth. If
we should ever change their orbit, for instance by
colliding with one of them, we not only would destroy
their usefulness but we would, in all likelihood,
destroy the <i>Carefree</i> as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry did not even want to think about the possibility
of such a disaster.</p>
<p>After the visit to the observatory, the captain
asked the boys if they would care to try out
the swimming pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, would we!&rdquo; Garry and Patch said together.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, as they were heading down
the corridor toward the gym, they passed Mr.
Klecker walking along stiffly&mdash;in full dress of
course&mdash;and carrying a stack of books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, gentlemen,&rdquo; the tall man greeted them
cordially, and the boys returned his greeting.</p>
<p>As he passed, Patch whispered to Garry, &ldquo;Bet
those books are about the circus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Garry smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>The boys had learned that Mr. Klecker had a
hobby. He was very much interested in the circus
of the old days. He had many books on the subject,
and whenever he talked to anyone it was about the
circus.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch had heard from the others that
Mr. Klecker still looked after the captain as if he
were serving him in his mansion. He would lay out
his clothes for him and attend to other small details.
Once in awhile Mr. Klecker would be called
on to assist in things of a mechanical nature, but he
hated to get out of his full dress and don greasy
coveralls.</p>
<p>The boys proceeded to the gym. They were anticipating
a good time. But something of a decisive
nature was to happen which would have an
important bearing on their future life aboard the
<i>Carefree</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c10"><br />10. THE LADY GOES WILD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Beat you into the pool,&rdquo; Patch called a little while
later.</p>
<p>He dashed out of the dressing room and dove,
with hands outstretched, into the water. Garry followed
right behind, tumbling into the spray left
by Patch&rsquo;s dive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is nice and warm!&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;And
we&rsquo;ve got it all to ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little way back from the pool&rsquo;s edge, Mac and
Isaac were lifting weights. This exercise was to
help them keep in good physical trim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Garry and Patch swam and splashed to their
hearts&rsquo; content. It was the most fun they had had in
a long time. They knew no one would ever believe
their story of swimming in a pool in deep space! It
was almost too difficult for them to believe themselves.
But they did not care if they were never
believed.</p>
<p>They frolicked in the water for about an hour
and then climbed up on the pool&rsquo;s edge to catch
their breath for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, I could spend twenty-four hours a day in
there,&rdquo; Patch said, flicking water from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could too, almost,&rdquo; Garry agreed. &ldquo;But I would
be satisfied if I could spend twenty-four hours a
day aboard the <i>Carefree</i> doing anything. Gee, it&rsquo;s
going to be hard leaving here to go back to the orphanage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Patch said sourly. &ldquo;Gee whiz, Garry, why
can&rsquo;t they let a couple of guys live the way they
want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can someday, when we are old enough,&rdquo;
Garry said. &ldquo;But the only way we could get around
having to go back now would be for Captain Eaton
to adopt us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s the answer!&rdquo; Patch replied excitedly.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as easy as that, Patch. In the
first place, I don&rsquo;t think <i>we</i> should ask <i>him</i>. He
knows how much we like the <i>Carefree</i>, and he may
have thought of adoption. But he should be the one
who suggests it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we could drop a hint or something,&rdquo;
Patch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d let him adopt us, Patch.
Don&rsquo;t forget, when they find out where we are,
they&rsquo;ll think we stowed away aboard the <i>Orion</i>,
and that would ruin any chances we might have
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t deliberately stow away!&rdquo; Patch
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, but how can we get them to believe
us? I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d even consider adoption at
this time, and I think Captain Eaton must feel that
way too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch sighed. &ldquo;Maybe later, then. Maybe someday
Captain Eaton will want us back. Gosh, I hate
to leave here, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life won&rsquo;t be the same any more,&rdquo; Garry said.
&ldquo;Nothing can ever be as exciting as the adventure
we&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard footsteps approaching and looked
up to see Captain Eaton coming their way. Missing
now was his usual sunny smile. He carried a piece
of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, fellows, the answer has come,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton said, and his voice was laden with dejection.
&ldquo;I radioed that you two had been picked up,
and they&rsquo;ve already replied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry hated to ask, &ldquo;Wh&mdash;what did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I suspected. We must return to the Von
Braun Space Station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping we had a <i>few</i> more days at least,&rdquo;
Patch groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that the sooner we straighten this matter
out, the better it will be for everyone,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton replied. &ldquo;And another thing, you boys are
still A.W.O.L. from the orphanage, you know.
However, it will take a couple of days for us to work
out a navigation plan and get a clearance approach
to the station. Sorry, fellows. I wish you could have
stayed on with us indefinitely, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the captain&rsquo;s voice trailed off, Garry had a
flicker of hope. The captain was looking at them
as if debating something in his mind. Would he
bring up the subject of adoption?</p>
<p>But, saying nothing further, the captain turned
and began walking toward the outer door of the
gym.</p>
<p>Then he seemed to think of something else and
came back. The boys held their breath hopefully.
Would he mention adoption now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else they told me that I
thought you&rsquo;d want to know,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;I
told them the story of your being stowaways accidentally,
just as you told me. They checked back
and found that the elevator attached to the <i>Orion</i>
was defective, as you said, and they are convinced
of the truth of your story. As a result, Officer Mulroy
has been cleared of any negligence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to know that, Sir,&rdquo; Garry said.</p>
<p>Once more the captain left them, but this time for
good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Patch commented unhappily.
&ldquo;No adoption. When he came back I thought
he....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping too,&rdquo; Garry replied, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve got
to go back, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac and Isaac came over, still breathing hard
from their exercises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help but overhear the bad news,&rdquo;
Mac said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to hate to see you fellows
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Isaac added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;We were getting to
like this old ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way I&rsquo;d almost like to go with you,&rdquo; Mac
said, with a faraway look in his eyes.</p>
<p>Garry guessed that the Scotsman was a little
homesick. His hunch proved correct, because Mac
began to reminisce about his homeland. He described
the heather on the hillsides, the flowing
streams, and the green vales. And yet, Mac admitted
finally that space was still a good second
home to him, and he enjoyed his life in the deeps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Isaac had no home he would rather live in than
the <i>Carefree</i>. As he talked about his good friends
aboard ship and the kindly captain, Garry noticed
the softness of the big man&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Garry had heard that Isaac was really quite a
sentimental fellow. Whenever he learned of a
tragedy over the TV, it would depress him. Later,
the boys were to learn that Isaac had a secret
liking for good poetry.</p>
<p>Both Mac and Isaac seemed genuinely sorry that
the boys were having to leave. It made Garry and
Patch feel good that they were so popular, but it
made them a little sad, too.</p>
<p>The next morning Garry and Patch woke earlier
than the others and were heading toward the washroom.</p>
<p>Suddenly Garry stopped and caught Patch by
the arm. &ldquo;Patch, do you hear that? There&rsquo;s noise
coming from the laundry room up ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch listened and heard the sound of splashing
and a machine laboring hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Running, Garry led the way into the laundry
room. But then he wished he had not been coming
so fast. His feet skidded on the floor, that was covered
with thick soapsuds, and he skated several
feet forward on his bottom. Patch, coming right
behind, could not help laughing at his friend&rsquo;s misfortune.
But then he too went down and skidded
alongside Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what goes on here!&rdquo; Garry gasped, trying
to get to his feet. The entire floor was a miniature
sea of soapsuds.</p>
<p>In his efforts to get up, Garry&rsquo;s feet slid apart,
and he hit the floor again. Patch had no better luck
than Garry. When this happened, both boys broke
into laughter.</p>
<p>They struggled several times to their feet, half
playing all the while, but did not succeed in keeping
their feet until the fourth attempt. Then they
held onto one another to steady themselves. Only
now did they see what was causing the strange
disorder.</p>
<p>They looked over at the big washing machine
against the wall and saw Katrinka standing over
the open tank, pitching clothes right and left out of
the machine and into the air! It was as if she were
having the time of her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Patch&mdash;Katrinka!&rdquo; Garry burst out
laughing once more. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone crazy! Something
must have flipped in her mechanism again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The machine was still making mountains of suds,
and they were flooding out of the top like a flow of
white lava. Katrinka&rsquo;s metal wrists clanged against
the edge of the machine as she went up and down
with her flinging motion, making a rhythmic clatter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, can&rsquo;t we give her some words to make her
stop this?&rdquo; Patch spoke loudly to be heard over all
the noise. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll wreck the place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember one of the commands,&rdquo; Garry said.
Then loudly he called out: &ldquo;Atten-tion! Atten-tion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not paying any mind!&rdquo; Patch said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be short-circuited again,&rdquo; Garry said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for Captain Eaton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to wake him up after the hard day he had
yesterday,&rdquo; Patch said, as he returned along the
corridor with Garry, &ldquo;but this is an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out that they did not have to wake the
captain. He met them, clad in his robe, at the door
of the dorm, having already been aroused by the
commotion going on down the corridor.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton yawned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Katrinka, isn&rsquo;t it?
Ben set her for laundry duty this morning, but I
guess her wires got crossed again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The boys cautioned Captain Eaton to be careful
about going into the slippery room. The captain
promised he would be careful and promptly fell
down as soon as he walked through the door. Garry
and Patch tried to help the captain to his feet, but
only succeeded in falling again themselves. They
scrambled around, slipping and sliding. Then
slowly learning how to become expert at moving
about in soapsuds, they finally managed to stand up
and stay up.</p>
<p>Carefully, the three made their way toward the
washing machine where Katrinka was still merrily
flipping clothes through the air. But by now she
was out of ammunition and was merely flailing her
metal arms. The captain used the command, &ldquo;Atten-tion!&rdquo;
several times, trying to stop Katrinka&rsquo;s wild
actions, but he had no better luck with this than
Garry had had.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton moved forward over the slippery
floor and groped for the control knob on the robot&rsquo;s
back. But then, losing his footing, he hung on
to the robot to keep from falling again. This
brought Katrinka crashing down onto the floor
along with the captain himself.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch each offered the captain a hand
and presently managed to get him upright again.
Garry had a hard time keeping a straight face. Captain
Eaton&rsquo;s face was red, and his beard was straggly
and sudsy. His soggy bathrobe stuck to his thin
legs, giving him the appearance of a saddened,
snow-covered elf.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Katrinka was still having her
fun, swinging her arms gaily against the floor as she
lay on her back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to turn her over,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said,
crawling nearer the robot. &ldquo;Be careful of her arms.
She can knock you over with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry thought he saw how the job could be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s both grab her right leg, Patch,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll give a good heave-ho and flip her
over on her stomach. Careful you don&rsquo;t slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did as Garry had suggested, yanking
fiercely on the robot&rsquo;s leg and flipping the metal
creature over, face down. But the motion also
brought Garry and Patch down in the soap again,
this time getting the suds all over their faces,
causing them to make wry grimaces and blow away
the froth from their lips even as they laughed.</p>
<p>But what was funniest of all to Garry was when
he saw Captain Eaton suddenly see an opening
and scramble furiously, on all fours, over to the
flailing robot. He threw himself upon her back,
fighting her as a cowboy would wrestle a steer. He
finally subdued her with a turn of the switch on her
back, which he was at last able to grab and twist.</p>
<p>Worn out by his exertions, the captain simply
flopped back on his hands in the soapy billows,
sighing heavily. Then the good-natured man
caught Garry&rsquo;s eye and smiled. The smile turned
into laughter, and presently all three of them
joined in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The captain later determined what had happened.
He found out that Katrinka, in doing her
washing chores, had gotten water into her electronic
parts, and this had caused trouble in her
mechanism. Captain Eaton made the repair easily,
and the robot maid was once more in proper working
order.</p>
<p>The boys were with the captain while he was
making the repairs on Katrinka in the workshop.
When the captain had put away his tools, he sent
the robot on her way. Then he looked at Garry, as
he washed his hands at the sink, and said in a sad
voice, &ldquo;Fellows, I&rsquo;ve received a docking date at the
Von Braun Space Station. We&rsquo;ll dock at 2100 tomorrow
night. That isn&rsquo;t much time left, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Garry replied unhappily.</p>
<p>The captain did not look up again.</p>
<p>Garry half expected him to say something else,
but, instead, he remained silent. Garry tugged at
Patch&rsquo;s sleeve, motioning for them to go.</p>
<p>The boys made their way slowly toward the door
of the workshop. As Garry pressed the button to
open the sliding door, Captain Eaton spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys turned. Garry gulped. He could see
the sadness in the elderly man&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I haven&rsquo;t told you how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed
having you with us for this short time,&rdquo; the captain
said, holding his dripping hands over the sink, not
bothering to dry them.</p>
<p>Garry had a lump in his throat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve enjoyed
it too, haven&rsquo;t we, Patch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Patch murmured.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton continued: &ldquo;You two have been a
great big lift in our lives. It&rsquo;s been so long since
we&rsquo;ve seen young fellows, and you&rsquo;ve made us feel
younger ourselves once more. I think you know how
we feel about your leaving us. But I don&rsquo;t want to
get sentimental about it and make you feel worse.
So this won&rsquo;t be good-by. We&rsquo;ll see each other
again&mdash;I know we shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry cleared his throat, trying to dissolve that
lump. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better dry your hands, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton smiled, reaching for a towel.
&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss all of you very much, Sir,&rdquo; Garry said,
before starting through the door. &ldquo;The <i>Carefree</i>
has been like a home to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were silent as they went on to the
dormitory. They were overcome by sadness at having
to leave the ship and her friendly people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>As the boys were getting together the clothing
and toilet articles they had been given, Patch remarked
to Garry, &ldquo;Maybe the captain doesn&rsquo;t like
us enough for adoption. He may not care for the
idea of being saddled with us permanently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; Garry answered, &ldquo;but I still
can&rsquo;t think of any other reason, now that the stowaway
business is straightened out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch didn&rsquo;t answer. He had no explanation
either.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c11"><br />11. A FRIEND IS LOST</h2>
<p>That night, on their way to dinner in the galley, the
boys were overtaken by the long-striding Mr.
Klecker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you&rsquo;re leaving us, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said
to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, Mr. Klecker,&rdquo; Garry replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad. I was hoping I would have the opportunity
to talk to you about the old circus days.
Yes, it&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gino, too, showed how much he liked the boys.
He baked them special pies and told them that
they were his going-away presents to them.</p>
<p>After supper, Patch said to Garry, as they were
leaving the galley, &ldquo;Gee, they&rsquo;re not making our
leaving very easy, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Patch, they&rsquo;re not making it very easy at all,&rdquo;
Garry agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not making what very easy?&rdquo; asked a
voice behind them.</p>
<p>They turned and saw the smiling face of Ben.
Garry explained to him what they were talking
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I guess you don&rsquo;t want me to say I&rsquo;m sorry
to see you go either, do you?&rdquo; Ben said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we really <i>do</i> care,&rdquo; Garry admitted.
&ldquo;But it makes us sad when everybody tells us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I won&rsquo;t tell you good-by, fellows,&rdquo; Ben
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just say &lsquo;so long&rsquo; for awhile. Before you
know it, you&rsquo;ll come back into space and find us
still cruising through the deeps in the <i>Carefree</i>.
Yes, we&rsquo;ll all be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does sound better that way, Ben,&rdquo; Garry replied.
&ldquo;But until then, we&rsquo;ll still miss all of you
terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss you too,&rdquo; Ben said quietly, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll
never forget you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys went to bed with a feeling of melancholy
that night, for this was their last sleep aboard
Captain Eaton&rsquo;s wonderland space ship. The
thought of leaving these good friends, possibly forever,
brought a pang to Garry&rsquo;s heart. But no matter
how sorrowful he felt, he was determined to be
brave about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Garry fell asleep thinking of all the fun he and
Patch had had in the brief happy hours of their
stay aboard the <i>Carefree</i>. Since the time passes
quickly during slumber, the boy expected he
would be awake before he knew it on another quiet
morning, and that very soon thereafter he would
be bidding good-by to his friends as he and Patch
made preparations for the voyage back to earth
and the orphanage.</p>
<p>But Garry woke far sooner than he expected. It
was not morning, nor was it quiet; the air was
charged with confusion and alarm.</p>
<p>Garry was aware of bustling footsteps and urgent
voices in the dormitory. His eyes popped open in
the bright glare of the lights that had been turned
on fully. He had a feeling that it was the middle of
the night and not morning, although he was not to
find this out until a little later.</p>
<p>Garry sat bolt upright in his bunk. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wrong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Gino, hastily pulling on his shirt, paused at
Garry&rsquo;s bunk. His eyes showed the anxiety he felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry and get dressed, Garry!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
and Patch. We&rsquo;re in great danger. We&rsquo;ve got to get
ready for the captain&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Garry leaped out of bed, his heart thumping
swiftly. The cold floor on the soles of his feet
shocked him fully awake. He seized his peacefully
sleeping buddy and yanked him without mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch, get up! There&rsquo;s trouble&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
just what kind yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch&rsquo;s eyes were still drugged with sleep, but
he struggled to a sitting position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble? Wh&mdash;what trouble?&rdquo; Patched muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I don&rsquo;t know, but Gino warned us to
get ready for the captain&rsquo;s orders. Hurry! Everyone
else is already dressed and out of the dorm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch needed no more urging and popped out of
bed. He and Garry quickly dressed and hurried
out into the corridor to see what was going on.</p>
<p>There was no one in sight. The boys went farther
along. Then, at the foot of the stairs leading
into the center tube, they heard excited voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, it seems to be up in the tunnel,&rdquo;
Garry said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried up the stairs. Reaching the top,
Garry, who was in the lead, looked down the tunnel
from which most of the sounds were coming.
He saw Ben, Captain Eaton, Mr. Klecker, and Gino
on or near the platform outside the flight deck, the
door of which was closed.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch pulled their weightless bodies
along the webbing of the tube. As they approached
the men, they heard Ben saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible! Poor Mac! And what&rsquo;s going to
happen to the rest of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going to happen?&rdquo; Garry asked, as he
and Patch came upon the scene.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton turned to them with a distraught
look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, boys. If I had hastened to get you
back to the space station promptly, you would have
survived this&mdash;this disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disaster?&rdquo; Garry echoed, with a sinking feeling
in his stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Captain Eaton answered, his voice shaking.
&ldquo;Mac is already done for, and we shall soon
follow after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Patch asked Mr. Klecker.</p>
<p>The boys could see pain on the men&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Carefree</i> collided with an <i>Explorer</i> satellite,&rdquo;
the butler replied. &ldquo;It destroyed the flight
deck while Mac was on duty. It looks as if he had
managed to close the door before he was swept off
into space. The collision knocked us off course, and
we&rsquo;re plunging into space&mdash;toward where, no one
knows. We can&rsquo;t so much as lift a finger to bring
her under control, and our antenna disk has been
damaged so that we can&rsquo;t even send an SOS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; was all Garry could say, sickened at
the sudden fateful turn of events.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Actually, he was thinking more of poor Mac than
he was of their own grim outlook. He remembered
how much the likable Scotsman wanted to return
to the heather of his own land after his stint in
space. Now he would never see Scotland again.
Garry absently watched Ben squirting a thick
liquid around the cracks of the flight-deck door,
probably as a safeguard against air escaping from
the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben has been outside in a pressure suit to look
over the damage,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said.</p>
<p>Patch turned away from the others, hanging his
head in grief and despair. Captain Eaton put an
arm around Garry&rsquo;s shoulder, but there was a helpless
look on his face that seemed to show the uselessness
of saying anything. Gino had lost his usual
cheery smile and could only stare numbly at the
closed door of the flight deck, where their friend
had been the victim of such a cruel act of fate.</p>
<p>Garry looked around at the ship&rsquo;s company.
Everyone was accounted for except Isaac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Newton?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Isaac is completely crushed,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton replied. &ldquo;He had just changed shifts with
Mac at the pilot&rsquo;s chair only a few moments before
the accident. He&rsquo;s blaming himself for the whole
thing. It seems he overlooked the position of the
satellite that hit us. He missed it on his last check,
and Mac did not see it in time. Isaac&rsquo;s gone off
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>It was indeed a dark moment aboard the once-happy
vessel. Things had happened so swiftly that
everyone appeared to be still in shock. No one
spoke again for several minutes. Everyone just
stood around idly, as if not knowing what to do next
and not really caring.</p>
<p>Ben was the first to try to rally everyone&rsquo;s deadened
spirits. He had just finished sealing the cracks
in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be some time before we can tell which way
the ship is heading. The collision changed our
course completely. Even when we do find out,
there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to control the <i>Carefree</i>.
She&rsquo;s just a runaway. But I still think there&rsquo;s hope
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes turned upon Ben questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That flier you two arrived in, Garry,&rdquo; Ben continued.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only had a quick look inside it, and the
console seemed in pretty bad shape from your and
Patch&rsquo;s efforts to start the engines. However, if I&rsquo;m
lucky and we have time before the <i>Carefree</i> hits
another satellite or something, I may be able to fix
it up so that we can escape in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only hope,&rdquo; Captain Eaton replied. &ldquo;I
suggest you get right on the job, Ben, and call on
anyone you need to help you. Meanwhile, we&rsquo;ll
sweat out the flight, although I must say I feel like a
duck in a shooting gallery because of all the flying
objects whirling out there all around us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are able to escape in the flier,&rdquo; Mr.
Klecker said, &ldquo;we can use its radio to send for
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben shook his head. &ldquo;The radio was removed for
some reason. There&rsquo;s only the empty compartment
it came out of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With faint hope of survival, some measure of
good spirits was restored to the astronauts. Ben
called upon Mr. Klecker to help him work on the
space taxi, and Captain Eaton said he would go to
the observatory to take a &ldquo;fix&rdquo; and try to determine
the course the <i>Carefree</i> had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to change clothes,&rdquo; Mr. Klecker said.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get my uniform soiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go and whip up some breakfast,&rdquo; Gino
said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all <i>I</i> can do, although maybe nobody
will be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton turned to Garry and Patch before
he left. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s going to be hard for you,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but try to feel hopeful about this situation.
A terrible misfortune has come our way, but try to
believe that things will work out for us. Chins up,
eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He forced a smile. The boys gave him a brave
smile in return, although they did not feel it any
more than he had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;May we go with you to the observatory, Captain?&rdquo;
Patch asked. &ldquo;Maybe we can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like. I know how hard it will be to
remain idle at a time like this. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the observatory, Garry and Patch watched
the captain at his telescope and other instruments.
He worked for a little while, then turned away
from his work with a brooding, disturbed look on
his face. He stroked his neat beard. Then he worked
again for several more minutes.</p>
<p>He stopped once more, but then resumed his
watching. He kept this up for some time, and, as the
minutes passed, his face grew more and more
serious.</p>
<p>Garry was afraid to ask, but he felt that he had
to know. &ldquo;Captain, is&mdash;is it bad?&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton shook his head grimly, the look
of despair in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well know,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
hoping I was wrong, but now I know I&rsquo;m not. We&rsquo;re
moving into the gravity field of the moon. My guess
is that we&rsquo;re only a few hours away from collision.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c12"><br />12. A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>This latest bad news filled Garry with a new dread.
But he refused to give up hope. He remembered
that Ben was working in the flier, trying to put it in
shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Eaton,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do you think Ben
will have the flier ready by the time we begin falling
to the moon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even guess at that. If there&rsquo;s not too
much wrong with the flier, he may get it repaired
in short order. But a major repair&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t
know. I guess the next thing now is to inform the
men of our course and get Ben&rsquo;s estimate of the
flier&rsquo;s damage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The three of them joined Ben and Mr. Klecker
in the flier a few moments later. The small rocket
ship was still held fast to the bigger <i>Carefree</i>, their
two air locks joined as if they were one ship.</p>
<p>When Captain Eaton had told the men that they
were headed for the moon, whether they liked it
or not, Ben replied, &ldquo;Well, Captain, I suppose
we&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to get the space taxi in shape in
mighty short order. I don&rsquo;t imagine the <i>Carefree</i>
will bounce very well on the moon&rsquo;s hard, rocky
surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think you can get it repaired in
time, Ben?&rdquo; Captain Eaton asked gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much time do you think you can give me?&rdquo;
Ben asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to do some more calculating before I
can estimate exactly how long it will be before we
go into final fall,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but, offhand, I
would say you&rsquo;ve got no longer than six hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben looked at the damaged control panel of the
flier and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll do it. I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone on the ship will be at your disposal,
Ben,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said. &ldquo;Call for anyone and
anything at all that you need in order to hurry those
repairs. Ben, there&rsquo;s no one else I&rsquo;d rather trust with
the lives of us all than you. You can&rsquo;t let us down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;That confidence means a lot, Captain,&rdquo; Ben
replied, his expression showing the appreciation
he felt. &ldquo;Mac gave his life for the ship. I&rsquo;d do no
less if it meant saving the <i>Carefree</i> and all you
guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you mean what you say, Ben,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton said, &ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t call on you to go that far.
Just get the flier in shape so that we can escape in
it and not share the <i>Carefree</i>&rsquo;s fate in crashing on
the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben shook his head sadly. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of
the <i>Carefree</i> plunging to her destruction. But we
<i>know</i> that&rsquo;s got to happen, don&rsquo;t we, because
there&rsquo;s no way of saving her. Captain, this ship has
become such a part of my life that I&rsquo;d almost want
to go down with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel the same way, Ben,&rdquo; Captain Eaton replied.
&ldquo;Life will never be the same again without
the <i>Carefree</i>. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll get along without
her deck beneath my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get out of this alive,&rdquo; Mr. Klecker said,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll just have to return to earth and spend the
rest of our days there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; the captain agreed sadly. &ldquo;Even
a millionaire is allowed a space ship as grand as
this only once in a lifetime. I couldn&rsquo;t afford another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben seemed to realize that precious time was going
to waste as they talked, and he began getting
his tools together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know everyone wants to help,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
I think that Kleck and I can work better together
by ourselves just now. There&rsquo;ll be less confusion.
I&rsquo;ll be sure to call on anyone else if he&rsquo;s needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Klecker had donned some old clothes, but
he did not look comfortable in them.</p>
<p>Ben listed more tools and equipment he would
need, and Captain Eaton gave the list to Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this to Isaac, will you, Garry, and ask him
to round these up as quickly as possible. I&rsquo;ve got
to get back to the observatory and see how much
time there is to zero hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isaac has taken Mac&rsquo;s loss pretty badly, Captain,&rdquo;
Ben said. &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll be working at
top efficiency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will do him good to have something to
do,&rdquo; the captain replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be of no use to himself,
or us either, if he just keeps on brooding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton and the boys left the flier and went
their separate ways to take care of their respective
duties. Garry and Patch went to the dormitory and
found Isaac Newton sitting on one of the lower
bunks, his head in his hands. They stood beside the
bunk for several moments, waiting for Isaac to look
up, but he did not seem to know that there was
anyone else around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isaac,&rdquo; Garry then said, &ldquo;Ben needs a few things
for the repair of the flier. The captain thought you
could round them up for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isaac still did not look up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isaac, we&rsquo;re headed for the moon,&rdquo; Patch said
urgently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to get the flier repaired within
six hours, or we&rsquo;re all goners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Isaac looked up, his gentle eyes red. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all my fault,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault that Mac is
dead! I didn&rsquo;t tell him about the satellite, and I
should have. I ought to be shot like a soldier for
neglecting his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t blame yourself, Isaac,&rdquo; Garry
said gently. &ldquo;Anyone could have made the same
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isaac shook his head, as if pulling himself together,
and held out his hand. &ldquo;Let me have the
list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked it over, climbed to his feet, and started
out of the dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, he <i>is</i> taking it hard, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Patch asked.</p>
<p>Garry nodded. &ldquo;I can imagine how he feels. How
many times have you made a mistake that you&rsquo;d
give anything in the world to correct if you could?
But with us, our mistakes have never cost a person
his life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Isaac came back into the room. &ldquo;One of the
things on this list is the sealer gun. It must still be
up there by the flight-deck door that was sealed to
prevent the air leaking out. Will you fellows get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Isaac,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;Come on, Patch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they pulled themselves along the center tunnel,
Patch remarked, &ldquo;Isaac didn&rsquo;t want to go back
up there. That&rsquo;s why he asked us to get the sealer
gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;But it will
save him some time just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the platform in front of the flight deck,
the boys stepped up onto the magnetized area. All
at once Garry was struck by the awesome silence
of this part of the ship. Along with this was the remembrance
of the tragedy that had taken place
beyond the door in front of them, and he had a
lonesome, shivery feeling.</p>
<p>Patch seemed to feel it too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry up and get out of here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
kind of spooky here all by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the sealer gun anywhere, do you?&rdquo;
Garry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Maybe somebody carried it away with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a well of darkness beneath the platform.
Both boys glanced at one another. They
knew that was the next place to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be down there someplace,&rdquo; Garry said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could it be down there?&rdquo; Patch argued,
not enjoying the prospect. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no gravity here
in the tube. Things don&rsquo;t <i>fall</i> in here like they do
in the rest of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been shoved off in that direction,&rdquo;
Garry said. &ldquo;That could easily have happened in all
the excitement up here. Time&rsquo;s wasting, Patch. If
you&rsquo;re scared, I&rsquo;ll poke around down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m exactly scared,&rdquo; Patch protested
weakly.</p>
<p>Garry held onto the railing and swung his feet
off the magnetized-platform floor so that he floated
weightlessly in the air. Then he began pulling himself
down into the darkness, using the metal lattice-work
that extended below the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you see down there?&rdquo; Patch called
from above. &ldquo;Want me to get a light for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel around a little first,&rdquo; Garry answered. &ldquo;I
may put my hand right on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one hand holding onto the metal stripping,
Garry fanned his free arm back and forth along the
floor. All he felt was cold smooth metal&mdash;at first.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, he felt something soft to his
touch. A chill raced up his backbone, ending in a
prickle at the top of his head. He swallowed, then
courageously began feeling around again on the
object, trying to identify it. His hand touched flesh,
warm flesh, and he could trace the outline of five
fingers. He felt that chill again, but he fought to
keep his nerves under control.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Patch called. &ldquo;Have you
found something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry pulled himself back up to the platform and
hung onto the rail, shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; Patch said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re white as you can
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found something all right, Patch. There&rsquo;s a
<i>person</i> down there,&rdquo; Garry whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c13"><br />13. ABANDON SHIP!</h2>
<p>Leaving a bewildered and frightened Patch behind
him, Garry left the platform and began pulling
himself as rapidly as possible along the webbing
of the tube toward the ship&rsquo;s stern. Reaching
the observatory bubble, he went in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Eaton!&rdquo; Garry gasped. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve
found him! I think I&rsquo;ve found Mac!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain swung from an instrument he was
using, and looked at Garry in amazement. &ldquo;You
<i>what</i>?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Garry pulled himself into the observatory, the
floor taking hold of the soles of his shoes by its magnetic
attraction. &ldquo;Yes, Sir!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Patch
and I were looking for the sealing gun in front of
the flight deck, and I found a body in the darkness
below the platform!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton clicked across the floor and entered
the tube. Garry tagged along behind, as the
skipper of the <i>Carefree</i> set out toward the bow of
the ship.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Captain Eaton was checking
on Garry&rsquo;s discovery. Then he came back onto
the platform, excitement showing on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Mac!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;His body is warm, and
I think he may be alive! We must call some of the
others so that we can get him up from there. In this
zero gravity it will take several of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry and Patch were sent by the captain to
round up the others.</p>
<p>Then several began helping to get Mac onto the
platform. Of course he weighed nothing, but, in
the zero gravity, the difficulty in moving him lay
in the fact that the others could not push him without
bracing some part of their own body against
something. Otherwise, they would only succeed in
pushing themselves backward.</p>
<p>Mac was finally moved onto the platform and
stretched out. He lay, suspended in air, a few inches
above the platform. Captain Eaton looked at the
Scotsman&rsquo;s eyes and tested his pulse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;His pulse is a little slow,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;but his
color is good, and I think he&rsquo;ll come around pretty
soon. That bad gash on his forehead must have
knocked him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They worked over Mac. Finally, he stirred and
then opened his eyes. He stared as if unseeing for
several moments, but then, as he began to recognize
everybody, a weak smile formed on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what happened, Mac,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton replied. &ldquo;Can you tell us? Can you remember
what did happen before you blacked out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac frowned, as if concentrating very hard.
Then his face relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I was near the
door when it hit us&mdash;whatever it was. If I&rsquo;d been in
the pilot&rsquo;s chair I would have been a goner. But I
had gotten up only a moment before to check the
chart. The door was open. I heard a terrific roar
and saw the whole console burst into a sheet of fire.
At the same time I felt myself being blown backward
and right through the door onto the platform.
I was dazed, but somehow I had the presence of
mind to know I had to get that door shut or the ship
would lose all her air. I managed to press the button
and saw it slide shut. But then my head began
to hurt terrifically and I felt dizzy. I reached out for
the railing to hold on, but I guess I missed it then
and unconsciously floated off to wherever you
found me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Garry found you,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said. &ldquo;We
thought you had been blown into space by the collision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Garry,&rdquo; Mac said, winking at him with
gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just so
glad to see that you&rsquo;re still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac, don&rsquo;t ever scare me again like that!&rdquo; Isaac
put in, his voice shaky with emotion. &ldquo;It was my
fault the collision happened, because I overlooked
the satellite that hit us. I knew your death was on
me, and I was so torn up I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever have
gotten over it. Thanks, buddy, for turning up as
you did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Isaac,&rdquo; Mac joked. &ldquo;Maybe you can
return the favor sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They told Mac about the existing crisis. He
wanted to do something to help, but Captain Eaton
insisted that he go to the dormitory to rest. Garry
and Patch went with Captain Eaton to the observatory
to recheck and see how much time the <i>Carefree</i>
had left.</p>
<p>After another period of figuring and using his instruments,
the skipper turned to the boys. &ldquo;I wish
I had better news, but it looks as if we have less
time than I had thought at first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The boys returned with Captain Eaton to the
flier. Isaac had taken over helping Ben, since he
knew more about this kind of thing than Mr.
Klecker.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton stood at the door of the air lock.
&ldquo;How are you coming in there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Ben gave him a report of their progress. The
captain&rsquo;s face was lined and grave. &ldquo;You may have
to do better than that if we&rsquo;re going to get out of
this alive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The moon is very close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton and the boys spent the time that
followed in the observatory dome, watching the
steadily growing disk of the moon. It was like a
mocking face in the sky, luring the travelers to destruction.</p>
<p>No telescope was needed, for the big, rocky
satellite of earth appeared to take up the whole
heavens. Garry and Patch studied the knife-edged
mountaintops, the dry, gray wildernesses that were
once thought to be seas, and the mysterious bowl-like
craters. Where would the <i>Carefree</i> plunge to
her death on the fierce moonscape, Garry wondered.
And would he and the others still be aboard
her when she crashed? Garry shuddered at the
thought. As Captain Eaton had said, Luna was now
so frightfully close.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The captain made a final check of his instruments.
Then he turned abruptly, heading for the
door. The boys followed him out.</p>
<p>In the flier, moments later, the captain said,
&ldquo;Ben, we&rsquo;re in our last hour. How do things look in
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry could see Ben&rsquo;s grimy, tired face turned
toward Captain Eaton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be close, Captain, awfully close,&rdquo; Ben answered,
and immediately turned back to the network
of wiring in the instrument panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do, Ben?&rdquo; Captain Eaton asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hope and pray,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll
be all up to me now. It&rsquo;s a one-man job getting these
wires hooked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could take one last look around the ship
during this last hour,&rdquo; Mr. Klecker proposed. &ldquo;I
have some books I want to take along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Kleck,&rdquo; Ben said, &ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t have
room for them. The flier will be crowded as it is.
We won&rsquo;t be able to take belongings of any kind,
not even for survival, except for the emergency
supplies the flier itself carries. The weight is that
critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a last look,&rdquo; Gino spoke up.
&ldquo;Otherwise I might not want to leave the good old
<i>Carefree</i>, even if she is going to crash.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; Isaac Newton added. &ldquo;I want to remember
her the way she was when all of us were
very happy and really carefree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing about Patch and me,&rdquo; Garry put in.
&ldquo;We came aboard without anything but the clothes
we&rsquo;re wearing, and we&rsquo;ll be leaving the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I surely hate to leave behind,&rdquo;
Captain Eaton said. &ldquo;Katrinka. She&rsquo;s only a robot,
but I&rsquo;ve had her for so long that she&rsquo;s almost like a
member of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From now on, every minute was beginning to
count desperately. Garry wished he could hold
back the hands of the clock. He wished he could
give Ben an extra hour. But this could not be.</p>
<p>A little later there came the announcement
that Garry had known must be coming finally. Captain
Eaton had been in the observatory for the last
time, and now he had returned with a final announcement:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now or never, Ben. Which is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben straightened up, and there was a pleased
look on his weary face. &ldquo;Just finished, Captain. The
instrument panel isn&rsquo;t as good as new, but I&rsquo;m
pretty sure the flier can be navigated by it, at least
long enough for a safe landing on Luna. Come here,
Mac. Let me show you a few things about the console.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Garry wondered why Ben was taking time to instruct
Mac in the navigation of the ship. Why
couldn&rsquo;t he do the piloting himself? Garry could see
that Mac was a little puzzled too, as he went
over to the instrument panel.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton was looking at his wrist watch.
&ldquo;Ben, there&rsquo;s no more time. We&rsquo;ve got to get off the
<i>Carefree</i> within five minutes, not a second longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few more hurried moments of instruction,
Ben said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready, Captain. Everybody into
the rocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who were not already in filed into the
rocket and belted down into the seats. That is,
everybody but one&mdash;Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, where are you going?&rdquo; Captain Eaton
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To check on the air lock, Sir,&rdquo; Ben answered,
and walked through the flier&rsquo;s doorway into the air
lock between the two ships.</p>
<p>Mac had belted down in the pilot&rsquo;s seat, as Ben
had asked him to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to ride without a seat, Ben?&rdquo;
Mac called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody ready?&rdquo; Ben called from the air lock.</p>
<p>All answered that they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start the motors, Mac,&rdquo; Ben said.</p>
<p>Mac started the rocket motors, at the same time
calling, &ldquo;Hurry up, Ben!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry heard a whirring sound, and the outer door
of the flier slid shut, with Ben still in the air lock
beyond!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, wait!&rdquo; Isaac shouted. &ldquo;Ben&rsquo;s in the air lock,
and the door&rsquo;s closed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one could do anything, for in the very next
moment the flier kicked out violently sideways,
bending everyone over in his seat. There was another
jerk forward as the flier went into motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; Captain Eaton called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben&rsquo;s tricked us!&rdquo; Mac replied. &ldquo;He cut off the
magnetic grapples from the air lock that held us
fast to the <i>Carefree</i>. How stupid I was! He told me
to take over while he checked on some last-minute
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it all,&rdquo; Isaac added. &ldquo;If we check the
weights we&rsquo;ll probably find out that we would be
overloaded with one more passenger. Ben was that
one more, and he chose not to come aboard rather
than risk the safety of the rest of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the captain said in a choked voice, &ldquo;it
seems that Ben elected to go down with the <i>Carefree</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c14"><br />14. FIRST HOURS ON LUNA</h2>
<p>Ben lost to them!</p>
<p>Garry could hardly believe it. Surely Ben could
have found <i>some</i> way to save himself. Did he really
have to make such a costly sacrifice?</p>
<p>No one aboard the flier cared to speak for several
minutes after Mac&rsquo;s tragic announcement. It
had come as a devastating blow to all of them.</p>
<p>Finally, Isaac broke the solemn quiet: &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
be the same with good old Ben gone. He was a
smart, brave guy. I&rsquo;d like to have an ounce of all the
scientific and mechanical knowledge he had.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>They had been so concerned over Ben&rsquo;s fate that
they had almost overlooked the fact that the rocky
wilderness of the moon was staring them in the
face; that in a few moments the flier would be either
touching down on her surface or crashing along
with the <i>Carefree</i> and Ben, her only human occupant.</p>
<p>Mac was guiding the craft into a slowly descending
spiral. This would give the flier&rsquo;s braking rockets
time to reduce speed to safe level for the touchdown.</p>
<p>The <i>Carefree</i> was not in sight, although Garry
searched the starry sky through the plastic walls of
the flier. He was glad he could not find her. He
would not have liked to see her crash.</p>
<p>Down below, Garry could see the huge dish of a
giant crater. It was within this area that Mac was
circling. As if anticipating Garry&rsquo;s question, Mac
explained: &ldquo;Ben suggested that we try landing on
the floor of this crater, which is called Hornfield.
It was discovered by a lunar explorer in 1983. It is
supposed to be covered by several inches of pumice
dust, and that may help to break our fall if we
make a bad touchdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From high up, the walls of the crater did not appear
very impressive, but as the flier spiraled lower,
they looked like lofty battlements of ancient castles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>As they dipped lower still, Garry watched those
grim crater walls close in around the small space
craft. Spread out below was the ocean of gray dust
that carpeted the crater floor. Part way up, above
the horizon, was seen the distant globe of earth. It
cast ghostly greenish shadows around the walls,
pits, and rock formations. This was the two-week
period of night on Luna, and the temperature down
there, in a nearly airless atmosphere, Garry knew,
was more than two hundred degrees below zero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone make sure his restraining belts are
tight,&rdquo; Mac called. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to touchdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ground rushed up to meet them, as Garry
felt himself tipped forward in his seat. The belly of
the little flier skimmed the ocean of dust, sending it
up in a giant cloud along both sides of the craft. The
flier continued to plow along through the pumice
until friction finally brought it to a halt.</p>
<p>It was strange being still again, Garry thought.
Another strange feeling was the gravity pull of the
moon, which he knew to be only one sixth as strong
as that of earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everybody all right?&rdquo; Captain Eaton asked.</p>
<p>No one said that he <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> all right. Garry and
Patch began unfastening their restraining belts, as
did the others.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton was the first to his feet. He moved
over to the window with a strange floating sort of
step owing to his reduced moon weight. Then he
looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we, Mac?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Inside the Hornfield crater,&rdquo; Mac answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any settlements close by?&rdquo; the captain
asked. &ldquo;Anybody who can come to our rescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-five miles to the southwest, captain,&rdquo;
Mac answered. &ldquo;Ben told me just where it
was and advised me to land as close to it as possible.
I thought this was as close as we dared approach,
because the ground is treacherous between
Hornfield and the settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of settlement is it, Mac?&rdquo; Isaac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An oxygen-mining outfit in the Taurus Mountains.
They&rsquo;re mining for ore rich in oxygen to provide
pressurized air for the underground terminal
of Luna City, five hundred miles farther to the
south. Ben said he thought they would have fliers
that could get here in a short time as soon as they
got our radio message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t have any radio,&rdquo; Mr. Klecker said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes we do, and we can thank the flier&rsquo;s lifesaving
equipment for that,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said.</p>
<p>He went to a cabinet built into the wall and
pulled out an oblong box. On the top of it were the
words: &ldquo;SOS Automatic Transmitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that was in the flier all this time and
that we could have used it earlier ourselves?&rdquo; Garry
asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you could have,&rdquo; Captain Eaton replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m familiar with this transmitter,&rdquo; the captain
went on. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the radio kit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this was done, Captain Eaton donned one
of the two space suits which the flier carried. When
he was dressed, he entered the flier&rsquo;s air lock, carrying
the radio kit. Those inside the ship watched
Captain Eaton walk about fifty feet from the flier
and open the box containing the transmitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, why does he have to open it up out there?&rdquo;
Patch wanted to know. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he transmit from
inside the ship just as easy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not nearly as well,&rdquo; Mac explained. &ldquo;Just
watch, and you&rsquo;ll see why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton took some things out of the box,
and then, after tinkering with them for a few minutes,
he set the transmitter in the pumice dust and
ran back toward the flier as if he had just lighted a
bomb fuse. A few seconds later the boys were surprised
to see something resembling a giant snake
spring from the ground beside the transmitter and
extend straight up in the dark sky!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world was that?&rdquo; Patch asked in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the antenna for the transmitter, isn&rsquo;t it,
Mac?&rdquo; Garry asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Mac nodded. &ldquo;That long ropelike thing is hollow,
and the antenna is in the middle of it. Captain
Eaton released a switch that caused the casing to
fill with compressed air, and that is what keeps it
extended into the sky. That gives us a much better
antenna than we could possibly have in here. Also,
being as tall as it is, the radio waves leaving it can
travel great distances and cross high places which
they could not do if it were short. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The transmitter is a very light and simple one,&rdquo;
Mac went on. &ldquo;All it can do is send out an SOS signal
from time to time; it can&rsquo;t transmit words. Yet
whoever picks it up can easily trace it. I hope our
signal will carry as far as the mining settlement and
that there&rsquo;s no interference between to block our
radio waves. Those mountains could block the
waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you think we can hold out, just in
case our rescue is slow in coming?&rdquo; Garry asked
Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we carefully ration food, water, and air, I&rsquo;d
say we could last about five days, earth time,&rdquo; Mac
replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure the captain will start rationing
right away, just to make sure, but I can&rsquo;t
see any reason why we won&rsquo;t see a rescue flier
heading this way pretty soon, certainly by tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton presently came back inside and
began taking off his space suit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we get out of this alive, we&rsquo;ll owe it all to
Ben,&rdquo; Isaac remarked.</p>
<p>Garry noticed the sudden sadness on the faces of
the others at the mention of Ben&rsquo;s name. Presently,
everyone in turn began saying something good
about their friend; that is, everyone except Captain
Eaton, whom Garry knew had been closer to
Ben than any of the others.</p>
<p>The captain was still plainly too broken up to say
anything about Ben at this time. He just quietly finished
removing his pressure-suit gear, and Garry
could see the tragedy in his eyes. Garry was glad
when Captain Eaton changed the subject, because
he himself had grown very fond of the brilliant
young spaceman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should take inventory of our stock,&rdquo; the captain
was saying, &ldquo;and then start a rationing schedule.
We can&rsquo;t be sure how long we&rsquo;ll have to wait
before help comes. I don&rsquo;t want to alarm everybody,
but there&rsquo;s always the possibility of radioactivity
or mineral deposits in the hills beyond the
crater which would keep our SOS from going
through. The moon is full of those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac&rsquo;s prediction as to how long the food and water
would last turned out to be fairly close, although
it turned out to be four days instead of five. No one
expected the fourth day to roll around with their
still being trapped in the flier, but Captain Eaton
was playing safe, as Mac had said he probably
would do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Those who had invented the equipment making
up the escape flier&rsquo;s emergency kit had seemingly
thought of everything to ease the plight of those
trapped on strange planets. They had not overlooked
the boredom of those awaiting rescue. There
was a special cabinet containing tiny games, and
there were also miniature books.</p>
<p>When the inventory was completed and everything
was done that could be done, Captain Eaton
distributed the games and books, and everyone settled
down in the flight chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; Isaac said, sighing and
stretching out comfortably with one of the little
books. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to read this book on
great poetry, but up to now I just haven&rsquo;t had the
time because it&rsquo;s so long. It looks like I&rsquo;ve finally
gotten my chance to read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any books about the circus,&rdquo; Mr.
Klecker said disappointedly. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll just have
to settle for what&rsquo;s left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler straightened his bow tie. He had
changed back into his full dress after Isaac had
taken over as Ben&rsquo;s helper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Garry and Patch started a game of chess, and the
rest of the <i>Carefree</i>&rsquo;s passengers took whatever
game or book interested them. Except for the sadness
of Ben&rsquo;s not being with them, Garry noticed
that there was an air of contentment and optimism
on the part of everyone.</p>
<p>Later, he was to be glad that he did not have the
talent of seeing into the future, for if those who
were so relaxed now in their cozy hideaway on the
dark moon had only known what was in store for
them, they would not have been in the mood for
enjoying <i>anything</i> at this moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c15"><br />15. A DARK OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>The idea of stretching out comfortably with a good
book and plenty of spare time did not seem so satisfying
after several hours. After this period, everyone
began to get restless, with a desire to get up
and stretch his legs, as they could have done if
they were back on the <i>Carefree</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel, fellows,&rdquo; Captain Eaton
said sympathetically, as he noticed how tired everyone
had become of just sitting around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
take a romp myself outside in a space suit, but without
knowing how soon we&rsquo;ll be rescued and having
no surplus of supplies, I don&rsquo;t think we should
use up our oxygen that fast. Everyone agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Then to while away the hours that were beginning
to drag slowly along, the captain suggested
that they talk among themselves and exchange stories.
This activity occupied the group for some time.
Garry was glad that poor Ben was not mentioned
again to further depress everyone.</p>
<p>Finally, all became &ldquo;talked out,&rdquo; just as they had
become &ldquo;read out&rdquo; before that. And by this time
some were ready for a nap and began dozing in
their seats.</p>
<p>Garry watched the captain settle back in his seat,
sighing tiredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should be grateful for being alive,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I feel almost as if I had died myself.
Yes, this is a sad day for an old man who has lost at
the same time the dearest things to his heart&mdash;one
of his best friends and a funny-looking space ship
that had come to be even homier than his earthly
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry noticed how much the conversation kept
returning to Ben. He guessed that the unselfish
spaceman would be on their minds for a long time
to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where they went down, Captain?&rdquo;
Mac asked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even see the <i>Carefree</i>, once
Ben cut us free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of us saw her,&rdquo; the captain replied, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m glad. I hope they never find her remains on the
moon, because I would feel compelled to go to the
site of the crash and I would not want to do that.
No, it&rsquo;s better this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before long, someone mentioned food. There
was some mild enthusiasm from the others, but not
much. Everyone knew that all there was to eat were
capsules that would provide nourishment but little
enjoyment.</p>
<p>Gino made a face when the capsule bottle was
passed to him and he shook two of the pellets out
into his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that I would ever have to make a meal
of these things,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;I, who at one time
or another, have served up the grandest dishes ever
put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All ate silently. Since the additional talk about
Ben, it was as if cold water had been poured over
their spirits.</p>
<p>After the brief meal the captain suggested that
the lights be turned down and everyone try to get a
&ldquo;night&rdquo; of sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think all of us are brain fagged and bored after
all that has happened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;ll be
someone knocking on our air-lock door before we
wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one objected to the idea, as it seemed to be
the only thing left for them to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>When everyone was settled down for the &ldquo;night,&rdquo;
Captain Eaton cut off all lights within the flier. It
was still not very dark in the flier because outdoors
it was brighter than the brightest moonlight night
on earth, owing to the brilliant glow of earthshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our rescuers do not show up some time tomorrow,&rdquo;
Captain Eaton said, &ldquo;we had better start cutting
back on our battery power. That will mean no
lights inside, except use of the flashlight in the cabinet,
and less warmth. I have a feeling that our batteries
will play out before any of our other supplies
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Garry woke the next &ldquo;morning,&rdquo; he heard
some of the others stirring about. Patch was standing
over him with two tablets and Garry&rsquo;s personal
water bottle which squeezed the liquid into one&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Garry mumbled. &ldquo;Time for my
medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine nothing,&rdquo; Patch replied. &ldquo;This, son, is
breakfast. Or would you prefer nice crisp bacon
and fluffy scrambled eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Patch, cut it out,&rdquo; Garry pleaded. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t have to make this any tougher than it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry took the food pills, chewing them slowly
to get what little flavor there was in them. Then he
finished off with the water, which was little more
than enough to wet his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, the captain has really rationed the water,
hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Garry whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;He cut it back even further this morning,&rdquo; Patch
replied. &ldquo;Know why? Because nobody came knocking
on our air lock as he had hoped maybe they
would. On top of that, I heard him say he was going
to run another close inventory on all our life-supporting
items to see how much is left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, do you think he&rsquo;s afraid <i>no</i> one will be
knocking any time soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Patch replied, &ldquo;but he has been
frowning quite a bit this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain presently made it clear to all why he
had been doing so much frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought those people at the
mining settlement would have had plenty of time
while we slept to pay us a visit. If our SOS reached
them soon after we began sending, as it should
have, they should have had a flier over here within
a few hours&rsquo; time. Our chief essentials for staying
alive are our food, water, air, and power supply
which is necessary to keep us warm. It&rsquo;s several
hundred degrees below zero outside, in case you
haven&rsquo;t thought about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took another inventory, and the results were
not very heartening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re using up much too much of our battery
power,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the weakest
link in our chain of existence. I didn&rsquo;t realize that
yesterday when we had the lights on for reading.
From now on until someone comes, we&rsquo;ll have to do
without light altogether except when necessary.
That means we&rsquo;ll have to do our reading by earthshine
and our one flashlight. We may have some
strained eyes, but that&rsquo;s the best we can do. We&rsquo;ll
also have to reduce our heat a little to save on power
that way too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, do you think we should check the condition
of the battery in the outside transmitter?&rdquo;
Isaac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to have a useful life of seventy-two
hours, operating automatically for a few minutes
every half hour,&rdquo; the captain said, &ldquo;but the battery
may have lost a lot of its power in storage. I
think it would be a good idea to check it. It has a
test meter on it, Isaac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out and check it, Captain,&rdquo; Isaac said.</p>
<p>When he had pulled on one of the space suits,
Isaac checked the air and pressure and went outside.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch watched him move in a light-footed
gliding motion toward the spot where the
antenna had been set up. He spent several minutes
with the rig and then came back into the flier.</p>
<p>As he lifted his helmet off, he said with a shake
of his head, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quit sending, Captain. You were
right. The battery must have been in bad shape to
start with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not sending,&rdquo; Captain Eaton muttered to himself,
a dark worried frown on his face. &ldquo;That means
that if our SOS was not picked up earlier, it never
will be, and no one will know where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry&rsquo;s heart chilled at hearing this. What the
captain really meant, but did not say, was that they
were doomed to a slow death as their heat and air
were depleted and they froze in the moon&rsquo;s incredible
cold. That would happen long before their food
and water gave out.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton placed a fatherly arm around each
of the boys and said, &ldquo;Fellows, I wish there were
something I could do. Believe me, if I could give
my life to save you two, as Ben did, I would gladly
do it. Do you believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir, I do believe it,&rdquo; Garry answered sincerely.
&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t we really do something&mdash;anything
at all? It&mdash;it&rsquo;s better than waiting, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trembling, both of you,&rdquo; the captain said,
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t blame you. If it&rsquo;s any comfort to you, I
think you&rsquo;re the bravest two boys I ever knew. I
would have been proud to have had a couple of
sons like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain pressed their arms affectionately.
Garry knew how he felt about his helplessness to do
anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;You ask if there&rsquo;s anything we could do,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton said. &ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re not giving up
hope completely at this early stage, but things do
look bad. We could ration ourselves severely and
maybe prolong our existence a few days, but after
that....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry finished the gloomy sentence in his own
mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c16"><br />16. A SAD PARTING</h2>
<p>They <i>did</i> wait&mdash;all the long day to follow.</p>
<p>And in all that time, no one came.</p>
<p>They did the same things that they had done the
day before&mdash;reading by the light of the earth,
which they feared they would never see again;
reading until their eyes blurred and the battery had
gone dead in their only flashlight.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch did not read much. Instead,
they spent most of their time looking out over the
cold gray dust, and up into the black sky, looking
hopefully for some moving object against the bleak
wilderness and wanting to be the first to spot it
should it appear. But it never appeared, and bed-time
came, but no one was in the spirit for sleep.
And yet, since there was little else to do, everyone
prepared for bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Garry and Patch lay awake in their adjoining
seats, talking in low voices to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, we&rsquo;ve been through a lot of close calls
since we left the orphanage,&rdquo; Patch was saying,
&ldquo;but this looks like <i>it</i>, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Patch. I just don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; his
friend replied with a troubled sigh. &ldquo;It sure doesn&rsquo;t
look good. I won&rsquo;t ever really give up hope, though.
There&rsquo;s still a chance that a rescue ship will come&mdash;maybe
during the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if it doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Patch asked. &ldquo;What if it
doesn&rsquo;t come tonight or tomorrow&mdash;or the next
night? How will we feel when we finally <i>know</i> that
we won&rsquo;t be saved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t think like that, Patch. It&rsquo;ll make
you miserable. You&rsquo;ve got to keep hoping, even
when it doesn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; Garry said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny about Ben,&rdquo; Patch went on. &ldquo;I mean
about what he did. He meant to save us, but it&rsquo;s
turned out that he&rsquo;s made it worse for us. It would
have been better if we had crashed along with the
<i>Carefree</i>, because then it would have been over
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the saying, Patch: &lsquo;Where there&rsquo;s life
there&rsquo;s hope.&rsquo; And I believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Patch said no more, and before long Garry heard
him snoring softly. This made Garry feel better,
and presently he too fell asleep.</p>
<p>Garry and Patch woke the next morning to the
sound of subdued voices around them. For a brief
moment Garry wondered if help had come during
the night. He searched the faces he saw, and
quickly his hopes were dashed. Instead of happy
faces, they were haggard ones that showed the lack
of sleep, and there were no new faces among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one came last night, did they?&rdquo; Patch asked
Captain Eaton.</p>
<p>The skipper shook his head and tugged at his
beard that, by now, had become scraggly and untidy
looking. The others moved in close, and Garry
noticed all at once that he and Patch were the center
of attention. He had a feeling then that something
important was about to be said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, Patch,&rdquo; Captain Eaton said slowly, &ldquo;you
respect my judgment and my experience, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the boys answered together, puzzled
looks on their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, you do believe I would do the best I
knew for all of us, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry and Patch nodded again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to say to the two of you,&rdquo;
the captain continued, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s very important to
me that you abide by my decision. Will you promise
to do so if I tell you it will be to your best interests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys thought a moment, then nodded together,
trusting the man they had come to admire
and respect.</p>
<p>Just then Garry noticed the pair of space suits
lying on the floor nearby, and they looked as if work
had been done on them. They seemed to have been
made smaller by the adjustable straps with which
all such space suits were equipped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you can see, fellows,&rdquo; the captain said, &ldquo;the
rest of us didn&rsquo;t sleep much, but we were grateful
that the two of you could, because it gave us time
to come to our decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry and Patch watched the captain&rsquo;s face intently,
the suspense building up in them moment
by moment. Garry had a hunch that he and Patch
would not like what they were going to hear.</p>
<p>The captain took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
come right out with it. The rest of us are forced to
face the sad fact that rescue isn&rsquo;t coming. But
there&rsquo;s no reason for everyone to perish. Garry, we
decided that you and Patch....&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his voice trailed off, Garry saw the picture.
&ldquo;You want us to take the space suits and&mdash;and go
out there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision to reach, Garry,&rdquo; Mac
spoke. &ldquo;We may be sending the two of you to a
worse fate than would happen to you here. But in
that way there lies a <i>chance</i> for you. Here the
chances would be very little. We are all agreed on
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why us?&rdquo; Garry protested. &ldquo;Why not two of
the rest of you? We thought we had become one of
you by now. We should all have drawn lots to see
who would go. It&rsquo;s not democratic this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re kids, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Patch asked.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re packing us off like children to bed! We
won&rsquo;t leave you here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember your promise, fellows,&rdquo; Captain
Eaton said. &ldquo;This is the way we want it. Believe us,
we really do&mdash;unanimously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s even a chance you might make heroes
of yourselves,&rdquo; Isaac added. &ldquo;You may find someone
who can come and rescue us before it&rsquo;s too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We realize it won&rsquo;t be easy for you to leave us
behind, and it won&rsquo;t be easy to set out across unknown
country for an unknown destination. It&rsquo;ll
take courage, gentlemen, plenty of courage, more
courage than it will require for us to stay on here,&rdquo;
Mr. Klecker said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Garry could find no further argument. The others
were too much against him and Patch. They simply
would not have it any other way. In the end the
boys gave in, but they felt guilty for accepting what
was seemingly the only way to survival.</p>
<p>Some time later the boys were ready to start out.
The space suits still were a little large, but they
would serve. Garry wore the luminous green suit,
Patch the luminous orange one. The boots were so
large that Garry and Patch had to wear them over
their shoes. The helmets were big and bulky, but
in the moon&rsquo;s light gravity they were not too heavy.</p>
<p>When the boys were sealed in the suits completely,
Captain Eaton ran a careful check on them&mdash;the
air pressure and temperature, and the
&ldquo;walkie-talkie&rdquo; radios that would enable the boys
to talk to each other. Finally, the fellows were
loaded down with all the supplies they could be expected
to need. This included spare oxygen tanks,
water bottles, and liquid food in tubes. These tubes
could be squeezed through an opening in the helmet
so that one in a space suit could take nourishment
without opening his helmet.</p>
<p>Garry argued against taking nearly all of the
spare supplies and leaving their friends with very
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take them,&rdquo; Captain Eaton insisted.
&ldquo;If you do not have enough to get you to the settlement,
there is no purpose in starting out at all. Now,
no more arguments.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>There finally came the moment of parting, which
everyone dreaded. Garry&rsquo;s heart was heavy at the
thought of leaving these people he had grown so
fond of in such a short time. Very likely he and
Patch would never see any of them again.</p>
<p>Garry could see that the men&rsquo;s eyes were troubled
and sorrowful. They didn&rsquo;t seem to know just
how to say farewell. Isaac and Gino gave a little
nervous wave of their hands. Mr. Klecker shook
hands formally. Mac gave them a warm pat on the
back.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton walked slowly over to the air lock
with the boys&mdash;slowly, as if he did not want to let
them go. Garry and Patch had removed their helmets
and held them in their hands. The captain had
his arms around their shoulders, embracing them
like a father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be sissies about this,&rdquo; the captain
said with forced lightheartedness. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just
pretend that you boys are going on a short trip and
that you&rsquo;ll be back in a little while. No sad words,
no tears, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we want it, Captain Eaton,&rdquo; Garry
answered, but his throat was so tight he could
hardly speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t give up,&rdquo; their older
friend advised. &ldquo;Take care of yourselves and don&rsquo;t
lose your heads if you meet a crisis. And don&rsquo;t come
back, whatever happens. It won&rsquo;t help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>The captain took a piece of paper from Mac and
gave it to Garry. &ldquo;Mac and I have plotted your
course as nearly as we can from what we remember
of this territory. We both had a course in lunar
study at one time. Follow these landmarks closely.
You will be heading straight for the mining settlement,
and if, by chance, a search flier should be
coming from that direction, try to catch their attention
by waving. They will probably be looking for
you, and your bright-colored suits will make you
stand out pretty strong against the gray ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry was studying the penciled map. &ldquo;What is
this gray part that you&rsquo;ve shown here, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an area of rugged rock formations,&rdquo; the captain
explained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to go through it, as there
is no way around. You must proceed with extreme
caution, because we haven&rsquo;t any flashlights left to
give you. And, owing to the fact that there is just a
trace of air on Luna, the earthshine can&rsquo;t penetrate
into the shadows. You will literally have to inch
yourselves along until you&rsquo;re in the open again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain explained more of the dangers in this
area and showed Garry and Patch other points on
the map and what they stood for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Finally, the boys had their last look at the man
who had been the best friend to them that they had
ever known. Garry studied the captain&rsquo;s brave,
forced smile, and he could see the elderly man&rsquo;s
efforts to keep himself under control.</p>
<p>Captain Eaton wiped his moist palm on his trousers
and then pushed the button that swung open
the inner door of the air lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I must tell both of you before
you go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I made application for adoption
of you two as my sons just before we had the
accident. I have a friend in a high position back on
earth who, I felt, could put through the papers
quickly if they were approved. I never told you this,
though, because I did not want to raise your hopes
falsely in case the adoption was not approved. But I
couldn&rsquo;t let you go not knowing what I had tried to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have liked you for a father,&rdquo; Patch
said.</p>
<p>Garry was too choked up to say anything except,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Patch, before we change our minds and
never go at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is better,&rdquo; the captain said. &ldquo;Good-by,
boys, and may God go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The boys pulled on their helmets, and Captain
Eaton helped fit them tightly. Then he made a little
farewell wave with his hand and motioned the boys
into the air lock. A moment later the door swished
shut. The outer door opened, and the bleak face of
Luna beckoned to them. They stepped out into
the gray dust, and the &ldquo;snowshoe&rdquo; plates added to
the bottom of their boots kept them from sinking
too deeply into the moon dust.</p>
<p>They were now on their own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c17"><br />17. DARK PERIL</h2>
<p>Because of the light moon gravity, the boys found
that they could move easily in spite of the deep
dust and of the equipment strapped to their backs.
The equipment took up as much room as it would
have on earth, but here it weighed only one sixth
of its earth weight and so was not much of a burden.</p>
<p>In a short while they were out of sight of the
flier. They had mounted a low-lying hill and crossed
down the other side. It would still be a long time
before they got out of the giant crater in which the
flier had landed, but by the time they did get out
they would be well along toward their destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to be making good time, Patch,&rdquo; Garry
said over his helmet radio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Patch replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much easier walking
on the moon than it is on the earth, once you
get the hang of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think, Patch. Captain Eaton really was going
to try to adopt us,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;And all the time
we thought he didn&rsquo;t care enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one in a million, Garry. He would have
been the grandest father a guy could ever have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean he <i>would</i> have?&rdquo; Garry protested.
&ldquo;He <i>will</i> be our father. We&rsquo;re going to <i>save</i>
him, Patch. We&rsquo;re going to save all of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to save them too,&rdquo; Patch said earnestly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure hate for us to make it and them not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t talk so much,&rdquo; Garry advised.
&ldquo;It uses up more oxygen, and I don&rsquo;t think
we have a surplus of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slogged silently through the gray dust in
the bouncy, light-footed motion that they had become
accustomed to by now. Every once in a while
Garry would glance about him at the forbidding
countryside of this dead world. Sight of the desolation
chilled his soul. He wondered at first why this
was so. Then he supposed that it must be because
there was so much absolute <i>deadness</i> all about. For
nothing could live in the numbing cold and the
boiling-hot temperatures that came to this landscape
periodically. No, he and Patch were the only
living creatures from one horizon to the other, and
this fact was enough to give anyone the shivers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Finally Garry broke the long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch, do you notice we&rsquo;re able to move along
easier now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because the dust is thinning out, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Patch replied. &ldquo;But I see the rocky country up ahead
that the captain was telling us about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Garry said, &ldquo;and from the way he talked,
it&rsquo;s going to be plenty rugged getting through
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They increased their speed, now that the going
was easier.</p>
<p>Garry stole a look at the big green jewel of earth
afloat in the black sea of space, for it alone seemed
to lend an air of friendliness and security to the
otherwise lonely, sinister surroundings. The walls
of Hornfield Crater about them were jagged as
sharks&rsquo; teeth as they reached up into the darkness.
The stars seemed to Garry like sparkling snowflakes
dusted across the entire vault of the sky. The nebulae
were like misty clouds, and there was the long
arch of a great comet crossing just above the horizon
and standing out remarkably because of its being
so different from everything else in the whole
visible sweep of the heavens.</p>
<p>After a few hours of steady hiking, Patch suggested
that they take a short break to rest and eat.
Garry was ready for the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Garry checked their map and compared the
markings on it to their true surroundings. &ldquo;We seem
to be still on course, Patch,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>By now they had moved up on a higher plateau
within the crater, and the dust had thinned so that
solid rock could be felt underfoot. But not far beyond
lay the wilderness of rock they had seen earlier
at a distance. How huge and forbidding the
region looked!</p>
<p>Garry stopped walking and plopped down in his
tracks, heaving a sigh. Patch sat down beside him.</p>
<p>Garry took tubes of liquid food and a couple of
water bottles from the pack he carried. He offered
Patch his share and took some for himself.</p>
<p>Each boy unscrewed a plate that covered the
mouth of his helmet. Behind this was a rubber disk
with a self-sealing opening in the middle of it. All
the boys had to do was thrust the tubes of food and
water through these openings and take them between
their lips. By squeezing the tubes, they
forced the contents into their mouths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a napkin?&rdquo; Patch joked, when they were
through. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to wipe my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Garry answered, &ldquo;but they haven&rsquo;t figured
out a way to do that yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch climbed to his feet, screwing his outer
mouthplate back on. &ldquo;Well, that wasn&rsquo;t exactly like
carving into a steak, but I guess it&rsquo;ll do until we can
get something better,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>They started out again, and soon approached the
forbidding rocky region they had dreaded. The
ground was rough and uneven. Garry looked ahead,
and it was like staring into the mouth of a vast cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be careful, Patch,&rdquo; Garry warned,
as he slowed down and held back his friend.
&ldquo;There may be bad crevasses across our path, and
they could be the end of us if we should fall in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry took the responsibility of going first. Patch
was right behind, holding on to a strap on Garry&rsquo;s
suit.</p>
<p>It was like going into a dark underworld thriving
with all kinds of unknown dangers. Although he
was following very closely, Patch could barely
see Garry&rsquo;s outline ahead of him. Garry would carefully
slide one foot ahead of him to be sure he had
solid ground underfoot.</p>
<p>After what seemed a very long time, Patch complained:
&ldquo;This is giving me the willies, Garry. How
much farther do you think we&rsquo;ve got to go? Besides,
this is slowing us down almost to a crawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see a break up ahead,&rdquo; Garry encouraged.
&ldquo;It seems we&rsquo;re making a wide turn, and the
farther we go the more earthshine I think I can
make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;d give anything I&rsquo;ve got for a light of
some kind,&rdquo; Patch groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the only thing they couldn&rsquo;t provide
for us,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;Remember we used up
our flashlight when we cut down on our power supply
in the flier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Patch returned.</p>
<p>Patch felt that Garry was slowly descending as
he walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where are you going?&rdquo; Patch asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be an incline going down,&rdquo;
Garry replied. &ldquo;I sure hope it comes back up and
doesn&rsquo;t drop off so that we can&rsquo;t cross to the other
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Patch shuddered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even <i>think</i> about
that. Remember, Captain Eaton told us not to come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep up with me and go slowly,&rdquo; Garry instructed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out what&rsquo;s ahead in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down, down they went on a gentle slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are we going to start up?&rdquo; Patch asked
worriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Garry replied, a little anxious
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Suddenly Garry moved too fast for Patch to keep
up and lost contact with him. Patch lost his head
momentarily and cried out, dashing forward to regain
touch with Garry. In his haste, Patch tripped
and fell on the jagged rocks. On the earth this
would have been a bad fall, but the weaker gravity
here saved him from serious injury. But the weaker
gravity also gave him a longer sprawl and carried
him down the slope.</p>
<p>As soon as Garry heard Patch&rsquo;s frantic cry, he
grabbed wildly in the darkness, hoping by chance
to reach his friend. But his hands met only empty
air.</p>
<p>Patch&rsquo;s shrieks were cut off abruptly, and stark
silence filled Garry&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch!&rdquo; Garry called, dread making him tremble
all over. &ldquo;Patch, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a mad impulse to leap down the incline,
grabbing desperately at anything within reach.
But he knew this could be disastrous for both himself
and Patch.</p>
<p>Slowly, Garry inched farther downward, heartsick
as he considered the things that might have
happened to his friend&mdash;a fall knocking him out or
worse, or a tumble down a deep, treacherous pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch!&rdquo; he kept calling. &ldquo;Patch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frightening moments of anguish were relieved
when Garry finally heard a faint voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch, where are you?&rdquo; Garry asked over and
over, as he inched downward, ever downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Garry,&rdquo; came the very weak voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Thinking Patch was still far off, Garry slid his
feet with more urgent speed through the utter
blackness. Then the toe of his boot kicked something
soft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; came a low-pitched, terrified
voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kicking the hand I&rsquo;m holding on
by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Garry realized what had happened, and the
thought of the costly mistake he had almost made
sickened him for a moment. Patch&rsquo;s radio antenna
had evidently been damaged in his fall, making his
call for help seem farther off than he really was.</p>
<p>Garry stooped down, his hands closing over the
gloved hand he had nearly knocked from its precarious
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry!&rdquo; Patch said, his voice still a little hysterical.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hanging on a cliff of some kind, and my
feet aren&rsquo;t touching anything! Please, Garry, get
me up before I let go! I feel my hands slipping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Patch! Try to keep holding! I&rsquo;ve got
to get a foothold or we both may go over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry quickly kicked loose dust from underfoot
and brushed it some more with his gloved hands.
Then he leaned over and reached for Patch&rsquo;s clinging
hands. He slid his own hands below Patch&rsquo;s
wrists, closing his fingers about those wrists for
dear life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good hold, Patch,&rdquo; Garry panted.
&ldquo;Brace your feet and help me as I try to pull you
up. Ready?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, Garry!&rdquo; came Patch&rsquo;s weak voice.</p>
<p>Making sure his feet were well anchored, Garry
pulled with all his might. For an instant Patch&rsquo;s
body resisted him like a dead weight. Then, with
an almost superhuman effort, Garry was able to
hoist him up ... up ... up and over onto the
ledge safely. Then both of them slumped exhaustedly
on the rocky brink.</p>
<p>The boys were quiet for several seconds as they
caught their breath in the pitch darkness and considered
how close it had come to being all over
for Patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; his grateful friend managed to say
finally, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it up to you. If we ever get out of
this alive, I&rsquo;ll make it up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t lose
anything when you fell? You&rsquo;ve still got the extra
oxygen tanks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dead silence followed, and that silence caused
Garry to feel a clutch of dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lost them, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked with a
hopeless groan.</p>
<p>Garry heard a faint sob over his helmet receiver.
Then Patch fairly wept out the words he next
spoke: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I did! Push me back in, Garry!
Push me back in! We&rsquo;re lost for sure now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c18"><br />18. STRANGE DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>It took a long time for the boys to pull themselves
together after experiencing this final fateful blow.
Down into the depths with those precious air cylinders
had gone whatever chance the boys had for
escaping alive from the cruel moon and for saving
their friends. Patch broke down and Garry felt just
as badly himself, but he managed to hold back the
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; Patch burst out, &ldquo;we may as well go
back and die with the others now! There&rsquo;s no use
at all in going on any farther!&rdquo; His voice still
sounded far off to Garry because of the damaged
antenna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we went back, then <i>they</i> would no longer
have any hope,&rdquo; Garry argued. &ldquo;We took everything
else they had. We&rsquo;ve got to leave them hope&mdash;even
until the end. Besides, we couldn&rsquo;t accomplish
anything by going back. Maybe, Patch, there&rsquo;s
just the barest chance that we have enough oxygen
to reach the settlement. Or enough to get out into
the open again and wait to see if a rescue flier comes
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not moving, Garry!&rdquo; Patch snapped in utter
despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going, do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> going,&rdquo; Garry said determinedly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going if I have to carry you! It&rsquo;s no time to
quit, Patch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when <i>is</i> it time?&rdquo; Patch shot back. &ldquo;You
and your hopes, Garry! Always hoping, even when
there isn&rsquo;t a smidgin of a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be only a smidgin,&rdquo; Garry said firmly,
&ldquo;but sometimes that&rsquo;s enough. Now stop being a
quitter and get to your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was only silence over Garry&rsquo;s receiver for
several tense seconds. Garry didn&rsquo;t know what he
would do if Patch chose to defy him again. He knew
he could not really make his friend do anything
his heart refused to do.</p>
<p>But Patch solved this latest problem himself.
Garry heard rustling sounds as Patch climbed
slowly to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I talked rough, Patch,&rdquo; Garry apologized.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve quarreled twice in all
our lives, have we? But we&rsquo;re in this thing together,
and we&rsquo;ve got to keep going, no matter how
bad things look. We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about keeping going,&rdquo; Patch returned,
&ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t even get across this crevasse.
How do you propose to do that? Besides that, we
can&rsquo;t even see as well as moles in this darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk along the edge, first in one direction
and then the other,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;Maybe the crevasse
narrows and disappears before too far!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began exploring the treacherous cliff edge,
moving slowly and carefully along in one direction.
Every once in a while they tested the width
of the chasm. Garry would get down on hands and
knees and reach out, feeling with his hand to see if
he could contact the other side. Time after time this
was done, but each time his hands met empty air.</p>
<p>After a tedious hour, Patch complained bitterly,
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s hopeless, Garry? Gee whiz, what
does it take to convince you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try a few more times,&rdquo; Garry replied doggedly.
&ldquo;Then if we still can&rsquo;t find a way across,
we&rsquo;ll start going along the crevasse in the other direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patch did not reply to this, and Garry knew how
bitter his friend must feel toward him after so many
setbacks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>The next time Garry got down on his hands and
knees and reached out, his probing hand touched
hard, firm rock on the other side!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a place where
we can cross!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Patch was heartened by this and made an
enthusiastic comment. In the hope of finding the
crevasse even narrower and safer farther along,
Garry followed the ledge, and, sure enough, it grew
narrower and narrower until it was a crack in the
ground only a few inches across.</p>
<p>Making the crossing to the other side, the boys,
in feeling their way along, found that the ground
began to rise again. Garry still maintained the lead,
with Patch holding onto him and following blindly
only a step behind.</p>
<p>Up, up the slope they went, and before long
they could see rays of light flickering down into
their eyes.</p>
<p>Soon there was enough light so that they could
see a little distance ahead. They quickened their
steps, although it still required some care on their
part to avoid the sharp-edged stones and rugged
underfooting that still lay in front of them.</p>
<p>But the light grew steadily brighter and the trail
flatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Patch, I can see the stars again!&rdquo; Garry
was soon able to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Then, scarcely before they realized it, they were
completely out of the shadows of the rocky formation
that had very nearly finished them. Above and
behind them once more shone the big bright ball
of earth floating among the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old earth!&rdquo; Patch exclaimed, with new
hope. &ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d see it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great sight!&rdquo; Garry agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; Patch said, &ldquo;we can see right over the
top of the crater wall in the distance. We seem to be
higher than we were when we started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that too,&rdquo; Garry replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check
the map again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry did so, then told Patch that they were still
on course.</p>
<p>They moved on and presently stood at the raised
edge of a gradually lowering basin that stretched
out very far and flat ahead of them. They could see
a break in the crater wall a few miles away, which
the captain had pointed out to them on the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;ll have easy traveling for
awhile,&rdquo; Garry said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll be right out in the
open in case a flier comes over. They&rsquo;ll be sure to
see us unless they&rsquo;re completely blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry,&rdquo; Patch said in a thoughtful voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Garry asked in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the way I acted. I lost my head
completely. When I found out I&rsquo;d lost the air cylinders
over the ledge, I just seemed to go to pieces.
It&rsquo;s a good thing one of us knows how to keep his
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Patch,&rdquo; Garry soothed. &ldquo;It could have
been me just as easy as you. Besides, that&rsquo;s not important
now. We&rsquo;ve still got a long way to go, and
time is running short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Patch ran past Garry in great haste
and stood staring over the plain below, shielding
his eyes with his hands.</p>
<p>Garry joined him. &ldquo;Patch, what is it? Do you see
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; Patch gasped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely
impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Garry begged, his own excitement growing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s somebody walking around down
there or else I&rsquo;m seeing things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry looked where Patch pointed, and he too
found it hard to believe his eyes. There <i>was</i> someone
or something moving around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go down
and get a closer look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hope it isn&rsquo;t in as bad shape as we are!&rdquo;
Patch exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>They hurried as fast as they dared over the
bumpy ground, heading straight for the person or
thing that was moving about in seemingly aimless
fashion on the plain below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sees us!&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming toward
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swiftly the distance closed between the boys and
the lone stranger. And then Garry and Patch received
the surprise of their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katrinka!&rdquo; they shouted together, not believing
what they saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Patch cried in amazement. &ldquo;Garry,
we must be seeing a mirage or something! How
could Katrinka...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Katrinka all right!&rdquo; Garry said, as the robot
drew close enough to be fully recognized. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t understand it. I don&rsquo;t understand it at all!
Katrinka crashed with the <i>Carefree</i> and poor Ben!
But even if she didn&rsquo;t crash, how is it she&rsquo;s wandering
around out here on the moon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what could make her start moving toward
us?&rdquo; Patch asked, as the mystery deepened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
never make me believe she&rsquo;s <i>really</i> human, although
at times it seemed that she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big robot stopped in front of the boys and
remained still. Garry and Patch felt almost as if
they should say &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; because indeed it was like
meeting an old friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>After a few moments of remaining stock still, Katrinka
turned and started shuffling off with great
long strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do, Garry?&rdquo; Patch asked. &ldquo;Follow
her? But that would be silly! She&rsquo;s still an unthinking
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Patch. This whole thing seems
very strange, although it may be that she was
merely thrown clear when the <i>Carefree</i> crashed
and somehow her works were activated by the jolt.
And yet I have the feeling that she almost knows
what she&rsquo;s doing, as if she wants us to follow her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking spooky,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t really believe that Katrinka can <i>think</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to believe,&rdquo; Garry replied.
&ldquo;But I sure would like to follow her a little way to
see just what she&rsquo;s going to do next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our air, Garry! We don&rsquo;t have enough to
waste on playing &lsquo;follow the leader&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little way, Patch. Who knows&mdash;this might
even lead to something important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re way off base, Garry, but I&rsquo;ll admit
I&rsquo;m curious too. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katrinka had already gained some distance on
them while they were debating what to do, and she
did not wait for them. They started running to catch
up and presently did so. But the robot traveled at
such a fast pace that they still had to move in long,
antelopelike jumps to keep up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Katrinka was definitely headed in one particular
direction because she varied hardly any in her line
of motion. She seemed to be going toward an area
where the rocks rose high and ominous looking. It
was much like the spot where the boys had had
their recent harrowing experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, please,&rdquo; Patch begged, panting for
breath, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s call this crazy chase off! That athletic
gal is running me ragged! Besides, she seems to
be taking us straight into those rocky walls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one thing certain,&rdquo; Garry replied.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>got</i> to change direction pretty quick, or she&rsquo;ll
crash into something. Let&rsquo;s stick it out a few more
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drew closer to the shadowy outcropping.
But the robot did not even slow her pace. The boys
knew she was heading for a collision, but there was
nothing they could do but watch.</p>
<p>Somehow she got past the first row of stones,
tripping and nearly falling, then recovering automatically.
But her luck was short lived. The path
went downhill beyond this spot, and her big metal
foot slammed against a boulder. The robot arched
through the air and crashed headfirst into a rocky
wall. It crumpled her metal cranium, spewing out
wires and electronic parts.</p>
<p>The boys came running up and stood looking at
the fallen giant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Katrinka,&rdquo; Garry said. &ldquo;She was almost
like one of us. It&rsquo;s nearly as if another one of us had
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I liked the old gal,&rdquo; Patch replied. &ldquo;She
may have survived a crash on the moon, but it&rsquo;s a
cinch she&rsquo;s reached the end of her rope now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry cast a look around to see what sort of area
they had come into. His eyes followed the downhill
trail ahead that Katrinka would still be following
had she not had her accident.</p>
<p>What he saw brought a gasp of astonishment
from him, and a nervous tremor coursed through
his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patch, look!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The <i>Carefree</i>!
There&rsquo;s the <i>Carefree</i> down there, half buried in
moon dust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rushed down the trail to get a closer look.
The giant space ship was indeed buried half of her
depth in pumice dust. The rear air lock was level
with the ground, and extending from the air lock
was a gangplank!</p>
<p>The boys moved up to the edge of the gangplank,
looking it over in bafflement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me Katrinka put that down and
walked out of the ship on it!&rdquo; Patch challenged.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get me to believe that, Garry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right; she couldn&rsquo;t possibly have done
that on her own. She might have done it, Patch,
but she would have had to be guided by an intelligent
<i>human</i> brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, what are you saying? Are you trying to
say that Ben might have survived that crash and
rigged up Katrinka so that she could go out looking
for us? Why, that&rsquo;s fantastic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon find out if it&rsquo;s so fantastic,&rdquo; Garry
said. &ldquo;The ship is nearly undamaged, as you can
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Patch asked, as
Garry moved ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to walk that gangplank up to the air
lock and see if Ben is inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could see that the gangplank had been put
down because of the depth of the Lunar dust. It was
obviously quite deep in this area, since the <i>Carefree</i>
itself was half buried in it. Deep, enormous dust
pits were very common on the moon and were
among the most dangerous obstacles to travel, because
they never gave any indication of how deep
they were until someone fell in and was suffocated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Carefully, Garry, with Patch right behind him,
stepped out on the narrow gangplank and moved
slowly forward toward the air lock at the other
end. It was a little unsteady underfoot, but it was
rigid and did not sink beneath the boys&rsquo; light lunar
weight. Besides, Garry felt pretty sure now that
Katrinka had crossed it, and she was far heavier
than both of them together.</p>
<p>Garry reached the air lock, his heart thumping
rapidly with hope and expectation. He raised his
gloved hand and began pounding on the outer door.</p>
<p>They waited. Five seconds, then ten, fifteen....</p>
<p>Garry&rsquo;s hopes began to dim. It didn&rsquo;t look as if
there were anyone alive inside after all.</p>
<p>But then the air-lock door began to swing open.
The boys scrambled inside, too tense and excited
to speak to one another. They heard air swishing
into the air lock. Then, after another half minute,
the inner door swung open.</p>
<p>Standing there inside facing them was&mdash;Ben.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="35" /></div><h2 id="c19"><br />19. A NEW LIFE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ben!&rdquo; Garry exclaimed jubilantly, rushing into the
main part of the ship. &ldquo;Is it really you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a ghost,&rdquo; Ben said with a grin, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s
what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever do it?&rdquo; Patch asked, amazement
written all over his chubby features. &ldquo;I mean
crash-land the <i>Carefree</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First tell me how the others are,&rdquo; Ben asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>Garry told him that they were all right, at least
for the time being.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Ben was limping as he moved about. Patch asked
about this, and Ben said it would come out in his
story. The boys had entered into the central tunnel
of the <i>Carefree</i>, with its webbing network, and
Garry noticed that Ben had laid down metallic
sheets over the webbing so that it could be more
easily stood upon.</p>
<p>Ben sat down on this and began his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had made plans to remain aboard the <i>Carefree</i>
before we even started working on the flier. When
I found that the space taxi would hold only seven
passengers safely, I knew someone had to stay behind.
I was afraid the captain would realize that the
flier would be overcrowded, but I guess he was
too busy thinking about other things. The likely one
to bow out was myself, because I felt that quite
possibly I might be able to bring the <i>Carefree</i> down
in one piece. I knew this region of Hornfield was
full of huge dust pits that could cushion the fall of a
ship if she belly-landed in one of them just right.
But don&rsquo;t think I wasn&rsquo;t scared even thinking of
trying such a thing! Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, fellows&mdash;I
wasn&rsquo;t out to make a hero of myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have had some control over the ship,&rdquo;
Garry said, &ldquo;otherwise she would have crashed
headlong onto the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had some control,&rdquo; Ben explained. &ldquo;As soon as
I released the flier from the <i>Carefree</i>, I started my
attempt to save the ship and myself as well. I
donned a pressure suit and went into the flight deck.
Remember, I had gone in there before, soon after
the collision. I had noticed then that most of the instrument
panel had been destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember too, Ben, that you helped build the
<i>Carefree</i>,&rdquo; Garry said, &ldquo;so you must&rsquo;ve known a lot
about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tore out the cover of the console and began
working in the section beneath. With tools, I was
able to get the braking jets to functioning. This
slowed the ship down to a slow orbit around the
moon and gave me time to work on the steering controls.
I couldn&rsquo;t do much with them, but I was able
to move the ship a little to the port or starboard
side, as I wished. I knew this was as far as I
could go, but with some luck I felt there was a
chance of bringing her down safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you try this before we all left the
ship?&rdquo; Patch wanted to know.</p>
<p>Ben shook his head. &ldquo;Risk everybody&rsquo;s life on
some crazy plan of my own? No, it was too farfetched
in the first place, and I guess I would not
even have tried it myself unless I&rsquo;d had to. The flier
was much the safer route to safety, and that&rsquo;s why
getting it to go was my first concern. With you guys
out of the way, I had no one&rsquo;s life to risk but my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you manage to land as close to the
flier as you did?&rdquo; Garry asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;My first thought was to land near one of the settlements,
because if I did make it, then I would immediately
send out a search party for the rest of
you. But I knew I <i>had</i> to land in one of the vast
dust pits on Luna, because the ship would be destroyed
by friction if it skidded along the bare
ground. I made one orbit of the moon as the ship
slowed down more and more and lost altitude. I
knew roughly in what area the flier would likely
come down, and I remembered Hornfield Crater as
one being full of dust pits. As the ship glided lower
and lower, I figured this would be where I would
try to bring her down. The pit we&rsquo;re in now is a
very large, long trough, maybe a quarter of a mile
long and a hundred feet wide. I therefore had a
pretty good chance of landing in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, you had a lot of nerve to try something like
that!&rdquo; Patch exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took one last look out where I hoped to come
down,&rdquo; Ben said, &ldquo;and then went under the console
into the working parts again. I cut out a few of the
upper braking jets, and this caused the ship to nose
down. I felt it plough into the dust as if into a big
flour barrel. The ship heated up from the friction
created, but it slowed her down rapidly, and she
came to rest on this spot, half buried in pumice.
Even so, I nearly missed the dust pit, landing only
about thirty feet from the edge of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what about Katrinka?&rdquo; Garry asked. &ldquo;You
did send her out, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. I sprained my ankle when the ship landed
and I was thrown against some machinery. I could
hardly walk, but I wanted to make contact with the
rest of you if it were possible. I then figured that the
old gal might be able to help me. I worked her over
so that I could operate her by remote control. I also
made for her a command disk, so that when she
moved near one of you or the flier she would give a
radio signal to me. I laid down the gangplank myself
over the pit, because I knew Katrinka would
sink down in the dust. It nearly killed me getting
about and using a hoist to lower the gangplank to
the opposite bank, but I finally managed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you sent her out?&rdquo; Patch asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I used a small telescope to keep track of her.
I couldn&rsquo;t be sure where the rest of you had come
down, but my plan was to start her moving about
in a gradually enlarging circle. I was hoping that
some of you would see her and come over to investigate.
Once you had done that, I felt sure you
would have the curiosity to follow her wherever she
led you. And this you two fortunately did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We nearly didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Patch said. &ldquo;We thought Katrinka
had been thrown clear of the <i>Carefree</i> after
it had crashed and somehow had gotten accidentally
activated as she had done once on the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>They heard a rap on the outer air-lock door. Patch
and Garry exchanged bewildered glances, but Ben
did not seem very surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the men from the settlement,&rdquo;
he said, limping over to the air lock and shoving the
lever that opened the outer door. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had
time to tell you yet that I got through a message to
them. You see, before I even thought of the trick
with Katrinka, I was working on that damaged antenna
dish that had prevented our sending an SOS
after our collision in space. At first I didn&rsquo;t have any
replies, and I figured there must be interference
from the Taurus Mountains beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be why <i>our</i> SOS didn&rsquo;t go through!&rdquo;
Patch said.</p>
<p>Ben went on: &ldquo;I increased my transmitting power
and finally got through. It&rsquo;s been less than an hour
ago that they said they would send over a Service
flier rocket immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men who entered the air lock a few moments
later were Commander Staples and his
lieutenant, both members of the Space Service.
They had been making a routine flight over the
moon when they had been contacted by the mining
scientists who had picked up Ben&rsquo;s SOS.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The two men had arrived in a big space flier that
could easily take care of Captain Eaton and the
others. Ben and the boys were anxious to get started
so that the long-drawn-out ordeal their friends had
been undergoing could be ended as quickly as possible.
Commander Staples said they could leave immediately.</p>
<p>The boys pulled on their helmets, and the officers
helped Ben get into a pressure suit. This was painful
for Ben because of his swollen ankle. Then, with
everyone dressed to go out onto the moon&rsquo;s surface,
Ben pushed the lever that opened the inner air-lock
door. Once outside, they started in single file across
the gangplank. Ben was in the middle and limped
along slowly with his hands on the shoulders of the
officer in front of him to steady himself.</p>
<p>On the way to the flier, they passed the smashed
metal body of Katrinka. The officers looked at the
strange robot with great interest, and Ben explained
her to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t remain out here to die,&rdquo; Ben said over
his suit radio, as if he were talking about a human
being. &ldquo;When we return to the <i>Carefree</i> one of
these days, we&rsquo;ll rebuild her, and she&rsquo;ll be as good
as new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were glad to hear this because now
they realized that every one of their little group
on the <i>Carefree</i> would survive the frightening adventure
and that once again they would all be together,
including their robot friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; Patch asked, &ldquo;will the <i>Carefree</i> ever fly
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to Captain Eaton,&rdquo; Ben replied. &ldquo;It
will take a lot of money to put her in shape again,
and that includes a powerful set of rockets to lift
her into space. But knowing how much the captain
likes her, I believe he&rsquo;ll spare no expense making
her space borne again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commander Staples said to Ben: &ldquo;I heard you
mention Captain Eaton. Our radio picked up a
spacegram that was addressed to a Captain Eaton.
We tape those messages routinely, and I&rsquo;ll be able
to give it to him when we see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Service flier was a sleek, streamlined rocket
with fins that were built to support the craft in the
earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, if need be. She also had powerful
jets for lifting her up off the surface of any of the
minor planets.</p>
<p>Commander Staples asked the boys to point out
to him on a chart the approximate location of their
flier, and Garry estimated the position as accurately
as he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Then, with everyone belted down, the flier&rsquo;s
rocket roared into action, and the craft lifted into
the dark sky. It was a very short trip, and the ship
did not have to fly too high. Commander Staples&rsquo;
assistant spied the flier and pointed it out to his
superior. The ship circled the area in a gradually
lowering spiral and came to rest about a hundred
feet from the small grounded space taxi.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Ben and the boys were
hurrying across the rough ground toward the flier.
Garry&rsquo;s heart was pounding so hard with joy and
excitement that he could hear its thumping over
his helmet receiver.</p>
<p>Those inside had evidently seen their rescuers
arrive, because the outer door of the air lock was
open to receive them.</p>
<p>Garry would never forget the old captain&rsquo;s happy
face when he saw the three of them enter. Nor
would he forget the tears glistening in the corners
of Captain Eaton&rsquo;s eyes as he clasped the boys to
his chest in a great bear hug that nearly squeezed
the life out of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for this great moment!&rdquo; the old
man said in a husky voice. &ldquo;And Ben&mdash;even you,
whom we had long ago given up for dead! What
have I ever done to deserve a happy moment like
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released the boys and clasped Ben to him as
if he were another lost son. Then the others came
forward, their faces gleaming with the overwhelming
joy they felt at seeing the lost ones returning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you old trickster you!&rdquo; Mac shouted,
pounding his friend on the back. &ldquo;How in the world
you came out of that thing alive I&rsquo;ll never know. But
right now I don&rsquo;t care <i>how</i> you did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome home, stranger!&rdquo; Isaac said, shaking
Ben&rsquo;s hand vigorously as only Isaac could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most gratifying to see you, Ben,&rdquo; Mr. Klecker
said in his butler&rsquo;s tone of voice, which, however,
did not mean that he was any less deeply moved
than the others.</p>
<p>Gino then came forward and took his turn at
greeting Ben and the boys. The celebration went
on for several more minutes, and the little flier was
pleasantly noisy with joking and happy talk.</p>
<p>But, finally, Commander Staples had to interrupt
the celebration with a smiling, apologetic
voice: &ldquo;I hate to break up this little party, but we&rsquo;ve
got to start back to the mining settlement. You see,
I&rsquo;m on duty and I&rsquo;ve got a busy schedule. They
have accommodations for all of you at the settlement,
and you can make your future plans as soon
as you&rsquo;ve arrived there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoners of so long a time in the cramped
quarters of the flier were only too willing to get out
of their prison. The commander and his assistant
went back to the Service flier to get space suits for
those who did not have them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>After the suits had been distributed, Commander
Staples gave a piece of paper to Captain Eaton.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a message for you, Sir, that our radio
picked up.&rdquo; He winked at the boys. &ldquo;Something
tells me they&rsquo;ll be as interested in it as you will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain read the message and then turned
to Garry and Patch with a warm expression. &ldquo;Boys,
it looks as though the adoption will go through as
soon as we go back for a short time and make the
arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo; Garry murmured,
almost too excited and happy for words. &ldquo;It
sounds too good to be true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the best words you could have said to
us, Sir,&rdquo; Patch added. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just great, Garry!&rdquo;
His sparkling eyes showed how much he meant it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a little strange being called, &lsquo;Father,&rsquo;&rdquo;
the captain said, smiling, &ldquo;but I think I&rsquo;ll get used
to it pretty quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Eaton stared off with a faraway look.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make up for lost time, boys. We&rsquo;ll see as
much of the universe as the old <i>Carefree</i> will carry
us to. Yes, we&rsquo;ll fix her up again if it takes the rest
of my fortune. You&rsquo;ll get your education among the
stars, my sons, and you&rsquo;ll be that much wiser because
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garry and Patch exchanged happy glances.
Garry thought they were wiser already, just from
knowing the grand skipper of the <i>Carefree</i>.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
